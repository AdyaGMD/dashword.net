## Want to help out?

If you're a developer and want to help out, that's great! Here's some of what you need to know:

- Dashword.net is a [Node.js]() application.
- The website is built using [Eleventy](). This allows us to convert markdown files into pages on the website.

In general, we need developers to:

- Upload articles to the website.
- Create profiles for new authors.

Believe it or not, anybody can do that, because the website is 100% open source! That being said, not everybody is skilled enough to do that, as they'll need to know:

- Markdown syntax.
- JSON syntax.
- How to create issues and pull requests.
- How to install and use Node.js (that's all you need to spin up a local copy of Dashword).

But as a developer, you likely know all of that! So go on, head on over to the documentation!
