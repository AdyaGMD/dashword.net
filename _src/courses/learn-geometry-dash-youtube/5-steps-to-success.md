{% alert %}
This lesson will cover mostly theory. As such, you will not learn many specific strategies to help you go viral. However, we still recommend reading this lesson to gain context for the 5 steps to success.
{% endalert %}

1. Idea
2. Title & Thumbnail
3. Story
4. Editing
5. Uploading

These steps are also listed in order of importance, with your **idea** being the most important, **title and thumbnail** being the next most important, etc.

Let's introduce each of these lessons in a little more detail.

# Idea

The idea your video is about is the most important part of a viral video. If your idea isn't interesting, nobody is going to want to watch the video.

There are many ways to come up with interesting ideas. We've already covered one method in the [starting from zero](/courses/learn-geometry-dash-youtube/starting-from-zero/) lesson, but we'll go over another type of idea in this lesson.

# Title & Thumbnail

Believe it or not, your title and thumbnail is usually more important than the video itself. Think of it this way: people can't watch your video if they don't click on it.

Because of so, we recommend you make a title and thumbnail **before** you start making your video.

In this lesson, we'll go over how to make titles and thumbnails that get people to click on your video.

# Story

Your idea and topic is why people click, but your story is why people watch. You need to tell the content of your video in an interesting way, and that's a story.

This lesson will go over how to make a story that keeps viewers watching.

# Editing

Once you have your video and story recorded, it's time to edit. This lesson goes over how to tell your story through editing strategies that maximize viewer retention.

# Uploading

This lesson will go over how to come up with good keywords for your video topic to maximize your videos growth.
