If you've ever wanted to become a Geometry Dash YouTuber, this course breaks down everything you need to know, even when starting from zero.

# How long does this course take to complete?

This course is designed to be brief. As such, it can be completed by most in just a couple hours.

## Welcome

This lesson is where you are now. It serves as an introduction to the course and doesn't cover any material. We still recommend you read it, though!

## How Videos Go Viral

This lesson gives a general look at the lifecycle of viral videos. In order to make viral videos yourself, you need to know how videos go viral.

This is a mostly theory lesson, which means you won't learn many strategies to help you go viral. However, we still believe this lesson is crucial to understanding the rest of the course.

## Starting From Zero

It is so much harder to go viral when you're starting from zero. But don't worry, as it's possible! This lesson goes over some strategies to make your videos go viral despite not already having a huge fan base.

These strategies work for both big and small channels, but are very important for small channels to understand.

## 5 Steps To Success

# Definitions

Here are two quick definitions you should familiarize yourself with.

- **Viral** in this course will mean any significant amount of views relative to your channel and niche. For example, if you average 100 views a video and upload one that gets 2000 views, we'll consider that video viral. While 2000 views is an improvement from 100, this course is designed to take you from 0 to 100,000 views and beyond.
- The **YouTube home page** traffic source is called **browse features** in YouTube Studio.
