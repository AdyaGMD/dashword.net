After finishing this course, here are some next steps I recommend you take.

- Meet other YouTubers of a similar size making similar content to you! It's a good idea to surround yourself with like-minded individuals to collaborate with and share feedback with.
- Get familiar with YouTube Studio. This course purposely strayed away from analytics, but learning which analytics your best performing videos max out is good information. *Quick note: a statistic lower than usual isn't necessarily a bad sign. But you should still try and max most statistics!*
- Watch other successful YouTubers you want to take inspiration from. Specifically, look at their titles, thumbnails, and video editing.

# Thank you!
