In order to get your article or course published to Dashword.net, you will have to agree to these terms. As such, these terms apply to anyone who has a published article or course on Dashword.net.

Remember to use a consistant email address when emailing us so we can verify that its you. If you lose access to your primary email address, [contact support](/contact/).

Do not share any email communications you have with us with anyone else. If somebody ever gets ahold of them, [contact support](/contact/).

Remember to check these terms often for updates.

Old versions of these terms are [archived here](https://github.com/MoldyMacaroniX/dashword.net/commits/master), along with any other changes made to Dashword.net in general.

# Article or Course Submission

By confirming that we can use your article or course, you agree that:

- You claim to own all rights to your article or course.
- Dashword.net can publicly publish your work with any changes made to it, but we will still credit you. For articles, you will be credited on the article's web page. For courses, you can credit yourself anywhere in it.
- All information on your unique author page will be displayed publicly on our website. You can request changes to your unique author page by emailing us. All changes must be confirmed by us but you can remove your profile at any time. In order to get a unique author page, you must have at least one article. Courses do not count as articles.
- You have not shared any email communications with us with anyone else.

If you would like to make changes to your submission first, please do so before confirming that we can use your article or course.
