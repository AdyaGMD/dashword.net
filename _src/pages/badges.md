- [Partner Badge](#partner-badge-requirements)

To be eligible for a badge, you must have at least one published article and meet the criteria for the respective badge.

Eligibility is not a guarantee and badges are distributed by our sole discretion. We also reserve the right to remove any badges from any profile for any reason.

*What the verified badge, staff badge, and partner badge look like on a Dashword profile.*

# Verified Badge Requirements

In order to be eligible for the verified badge, you must meet at least one of the following criteria:

- 10,000 or more subscribers on YouTube
- 10,000 or more followers on Twitch
- 10,000 or more followers on Twitter
- 10,000 or more Discord server members
- 10,000 or more monthly website visitors
- In-game moderator
- Have a level featured in the map packs or gauntlets
- 50 or more creator points in-game

In addition, the respective platform above that meets the verified badge requirements must be involved in Geometry Dash.

# Staff Badge Requirements

To be eligible for the staff badge, you must be an official Dashword staff. Dashword staff include frequent writers and developers who have been selected by Dashword.

Just because you publish articles on our site or contribute to our codebase does not automatically make you a staff. Staff are selected by Dashword and have additional, private responsibilities.

If you write for us a lot or work on our public repository and would be interested in becoming a Dashword staff, [send us an email](/contact/).

# Partner Badge Requirements

To be eligible for the partner badge, you must be an official Dashword partner. We are only accepting mutual partnerships if they are from other Geometry Dash entities, including Discord communities, popular figures, and other Geometry Dash related websites. They do not have to be official (endorsed by RobTop Games).

If you would like to do a mutual partnership with us of any sort and you meet this criteria, [send us an email](/contact/).

# I meet the requirements, now what?

If you are an author on this website and meet the requirements for a specific badge, [send us an email](/contact/) to apply for the badge.

There is no limit to the amount of badges you can have, meaning if you meet the requirements for both the verified badge and the staff badge, you are eligible to have both on your profile.
