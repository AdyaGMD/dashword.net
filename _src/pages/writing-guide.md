# Article Template

Copy and paste the following article template into your text editor of choice (preferably a markdown editor).

```md
---
title: "(Choose a title idea with lots of keywords)"
desc: "(Write a 1-2 sentence article description using lots of keywords)"
image: (Link to an image)
imageSource: (Link to the image source)
date: 2022-10-02
tags:
    - "2.2"
    - "featured"
author: (your author key, if you have one)
---

(Give a quick introduction to the topic and use lots of keywords. This should be 2-3 paragraphs)

(If there are lots of article sections, include a table of contents)

# (Article sections, separated using headings)

(Explain what you need to explain, using lots of lists and keywords)

---

(Quick 1-2 paragraph summary)

(Link to related content on Dashword)
```

Most fields such as the title and description will be written by a Dashword editor. If you want to include a table of contents, indicate where in your article (after the introduction is most recommended). Other details such as links will be sprinkled in by Dashword editors but you can include any you feel are necessary.
