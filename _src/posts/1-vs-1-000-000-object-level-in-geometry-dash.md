This was a very challenging video to make. It turns out that Geometry Dash can barely handle levels with so many objects. Fortunately, we pulled through and finished the video.

While I write a lot here on [Dashword](/authors/moldymacaronix/), I also make [Geometry Dash videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCseHDTIJ6ecGo2WcNAFLFCg/videos) on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCseHDTIJ6ecGo2WcNAFLFCg). Use those links to see it!
