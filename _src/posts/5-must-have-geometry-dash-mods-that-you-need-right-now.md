Geometry Dash is a good game, but there are some things that are mildly annoying. Whether that's with the game's level editor, menus, or features, there are things that could use some improving.

But fortunately, there are some incredible mods that will upgrade your playing experience ten-fold! From improving the level editor, fixing the menus, and adding new features, here are 10 must-have mods for Geometry Dash 2.113.

After developing Geometry Dash in 2013, RobTop Games has continuously added content. But with no new major content since the release of update 2.1, these mods will improve your Geometry Dash experience in ways RobTop has yet to do.

# Better Edit

Better Edit is a mod that improves the Geometry Dash editor. It adds a whole lot of new features, including advanced scaling, template building, auto-saving, and much more.

Better Edit also adds some improved UIs, but they can be reverted to the original if you prefer the default UIs.

# Better Info

Better Info is a mod that improves Geometry Dash menus by adding a lot of new options! For example, it adds more filters for searching levels, green user profile viewing, viewing level comments without needing to download the level, and a whole lot of extra level features!

One of its coolest features is the ability to see how long it took a level to be created. This goes to show just how long some people spend making their levels!

# GD Share

Gï»¿D Share is a mod that allows for exporting and importing of Geometry Dash levels. You can export your level as a file, send that file to a friend, and they can import that file and play your level!

This is great for collabs, as it means you don't have to rely on Geometry Dash's servers when sending levels to your friends.
