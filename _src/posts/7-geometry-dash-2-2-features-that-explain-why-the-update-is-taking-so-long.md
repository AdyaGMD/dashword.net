With the [Geometry Dash 2.2 release date around the corner](/posts/robtop-confirms-third-and-final-geometry-dash-2-2-release-date/), many new features will be added to Geometry Dash. But as we've been waiting [over 6 years for Geometry Dash 2.2](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-wait-turns-6-years-old/), which of these features explain why the game's 2.2 update is taking so long?

These 7 features are some of the biggest additions Geometry Dash has ever seen and explain why update 2.2 is taking so long.

# Versus Mode

Versus Mode was [one of the earliest features](/posts/why-is-2-2-taking-so-long/) said to be in Geometry Dash 2.2. This new addition will allow players to race levels in real time. Whoever completes the level first, wins.

However, unlike real time multiplayer, you would not be able to see other players.

Unfortunately, [RobTop had to cancel Versus Mode after 6 years of development](/posts/robtop-cancels-geometry-dash-2-2-versus-mode-after-6-years-of-development/). However, he expects to resume development and release it after 2.2.

# Platformer Mode
