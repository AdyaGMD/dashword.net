The famous Geometry Dash YouTuber and extreme demon player AeonAir has achieved a world record in Geometry Dash, being the first person ever to beat 1000 demons in a single month.

That requires beating over 30 demons a day.

AeonAir [went on to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEouSR4ELPs) the following after beating the 1000 demons:

> That [was] the most mentally draining thing I've ever done in my entire life

Despite that, his challenge is complete and he can now rest having beaten 1000 demons, the hardest difficulty of levels in the game, in only one month.
