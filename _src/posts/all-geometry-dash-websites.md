Geometry Dash has many popular projects. From news sources like [GD Today](https://twitter.com/today_gd), all the way to entire communities like the [GD Creator School](/authors/gdcs/), there are lots of awesome efforts started by the Geometry Dash community.

However, there are a good few Geometry Dash projects without the limitations of social medias such as Twitter and Discord. These are Geometry Dash websites, and there are a surprising amount of them!

1. [Dashword](#dashword-(dashword.net))
2. [GDBrowser](#gdbrowser-(gdbrowser.com))
3. [Demon List](#demon-list-(pointercrate.com))
4. [Geometry Dash Demon Progression](#geometry-dash-demon-progression-(gddp.pro))
5. [MyDemonList](#mydemonlist-(mydemonlist.com))

# Dashword ([dashword.net](/))

Yes, we're covering [our own website first](/)!

Dashword i﻿s a Geometry Dash news source. It is at the forefront of [Geometry Dash 2.2](/categories/2.2/) and [Demon List](/categories/demonlist/) news.

Dashword is estimated to be the **third largest website** on this list, [attracting over ten thousand monthly readers](https://www.dashword.net/posts/dashword-surpasses-10-000-monthly-readers/).

You can find out more [on our about page](/about/).

# GDBrowser ([gdbrowser.com](https://gdbrowser.com/))

![GDBrowser's home page user interface](https://i.imgur.com/CbiLiqn.png)

*GDBrowser's home page user interface.*

G﻿DBrowser is estimated to be the **first or second largest website** on this list. It allows you to browse Geometry Dash's levels, profiles, and comments all from its website.

Whether or not it is bigger than the Demon List is unknown, but we estimate that it is bigger than Dashword.

# Demon List ([pointercrate.com](https://pointercrate.com/))

*Demon List's user interface.*

The [Pointercrate Demon List](/categories/demonlist/) is estimated to be the **first or second largest website** on this list, as we are unsure as to whether or not GDBrowser gets more monthly visitors.

This project is the most popular ranking of Geometry Dash's hardest levels. It offers a leaderboard where players can compete against each other.

While there are other Demon Lists out there, this is the most popular and is what most people referring to the "Demon List" mean.

# Geometry Dash Demon Progression ([gddp.pro](https://gddp.pro/))

*Geometry Dash Demon Progression's user interface. It has some holiday snow on it for the month of December!*

The Geometry Dash Demon Progression is a list of recommended demons to complete in order to improve your skill, founded by popular player Trusta. You can log in to track which demons you've beaten as well as earn badges and other rewards.

It is likely the **fourth largest website** on this list as well, although this is purely speculations as we know very little about how many visitors this website gets on a monthly basis.

# MyDemonList ([mydemonlist.com](https://mydemonlist.com/))

*MyDemonList's planned user interface, screenshot from [MyDemonList](https://twitter.com/MyDemonList/status/1578883374785011713).*

MyDemonList is currently **work in progress** and currently only displays a waiting page. When released, it will allow you to review Geometry Dash levels.

It is essentially a Geometry Dash level review site. Like some movie review sites, you will be able to rate Geometry Dash levels and write reviews for them.

# GD Vault ([gdvault.net](https://gdvault.net))

*GD Vault's user interface.*

GD Vault is a website that houses information on a bunch of Geometry Dash levels with secret ways. You can browse its list of levels to grind free stars.

This website is very new so it is **unknown how popular it is** at the moment.

Seeing so many Geometry Dash projects, big or small, that choose to be on the web is amazing. As the lead developer of this very website, its so nice to see others choose to build their idea on the web, rather than on a social platform such as Twitter or Discord.

Do you have any ideas or websites for this list? Is there anything we missed? Let us know in the comments below!

For more list articles like this one, [see our articles posted in list](/categories/list/) or [other categories](/categories/).

**December 19, 2022 Update:** We've removed GD Docs, Extreme Demon Roulette, and Geometry Dash Heardle from this list for them being less serious projects and more of temporary gimmicks. From here on out, we will only add websites that have its own domain.
