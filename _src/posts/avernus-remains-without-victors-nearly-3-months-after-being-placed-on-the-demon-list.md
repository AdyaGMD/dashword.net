The Geometry Dash top 2 extreme demon, Avernus, has remained without a victor for nearly 3 months. In fact, it hasn't even got a single qualifying record yet (a record that is 59% or greater).

Thus far, Zoink is the only person to have beaten the level, being the one who verified it. No one else has even come close, not even being at the required 59% to be shown on the [Pointercrate Demon List](/posts/geometry-dash-demon-list-where-to-find-the-hardest-demons/).

This could mean that **Avernus has a shot at being moved to top 1**, which would make it [the hardest demon in Geometry Dash](/posts/geometry-dash-levels-what-is-the-hardest-level-ever-made/).

Right now, however, Zoink is the only player qualified to suggest this change, and the Demon List team wants to hear more opinions first. They even went on to say that this level's placement is highly subject to change.
