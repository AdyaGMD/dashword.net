In an unexpected decision from the [Demon List](/posts/geometry-dash-demon-list-where-to-find-the-hardest-demons/) team, [Avernus](/posts/geometry-dash-avernus-remains-without-victors-3-months-after-being-placed-on-the-demon-list/) and [Acheron](/posts/breaking-acheron-takes-1-spot-on-geometry-dash-demonlist/) have swapped places. This dethrones Acheron from its top 1 spot after over a year.

It is unknown whether or not [Tidal Wave](/posts/new-top-1-geometry-dash-demon-tidal-wave-verified-by-zoink-in-50000-attempts/) will place above Avernus, meaning it might no longer have a chance to be the [top 1 hardest demon](/posts/geometry-dash-levels-top-10-hardest-extreme-demons-2022/).

However, not all players approve of this change, with some choosing to start and sign a [petition](https://www.change.org/p/raise-acheron-to-1-on-the-demonlist) against this decision.
