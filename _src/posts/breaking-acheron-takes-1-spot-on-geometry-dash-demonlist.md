Geometry Dash extreme demon Acheron was placed at the #2 spot on the Pointercrate demonlist when it was first placed 11 days ago. But now, it has been moved to the top 1 spot, making it the hardest level ever made in Geometry Dash

This change has finally dethroned Slaughterhouse, a Geometry Dash level [notorious for never being dethroned](/posts/geometry-dash-slaughterhouse-top-1/). But will things stay this way?[](/posts/geometry-dash-slaughterhouse-top-1/)

Slaughterhouse is known for making unprecedented comebacks. Will the same happen this time? Is it only a matter of time before Slaughterhouse regains the top 1 spot?

# D﻿emonlist Controversy Update

T﻿he [demonlist controversy](/posts/geometry-dash-the-problem-with-the-demonlist/) has died down, which may or may not have affected the demonlist team's decision to make Acheron to the top. However, as is [clearly evident](/geometry-dash-acheron-places-top-2-on-demonlist/), this is a change that majority of the Geometry Dash community will approve of.

B﻿ut we are also left wondering [whether Mayhem can get the same treatment as Acheron](/posts/geometry-dash-mayhem-places-top-10-in-demonlist/). It is another supposedly top 5 hardest level that got placed at the #10 spot. Like when Acheron was underrated, it sparked some Geometry Dash community backlash.

S﻿o who knows? Maybe this change is here to stay. Or maybe in due time, Slaughterhouse will take the lead once again.
