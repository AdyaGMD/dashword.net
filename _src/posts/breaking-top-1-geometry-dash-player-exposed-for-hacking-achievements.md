The world's best Geometry Dash player, SpaceUK, has been exposed by the [Demon List leader](https://youtu.be/I2RTFwn_zho) for cheating his accomplishments.

This comes as a shock to the whole Geometry Dash community, especially since he got away with it for over a year.

In SpaceUK's first confession, [he says](https://twitter.com/spadeuk/status/1650961282508419080):

> Every Main list after my Sephiroth mainlist completion in may 8th 2022 was hacked. I lost interest in actually playing the game and wanted to see how long i could go without being caught.

Notable demons SpaceUK admitted to cheating include [Kyouki](/posts/geometry-dash-kyouki-new-top-3-extreme-demon-explained/), [Abyss of Darkness](/posts/geometry-dash-levels-top-10-hardest-extreme-demons-2022/), and [Acheron](/posts/breaking-acheron-takes-1-spot-on-geometry-dash-demonlist/).

However, subsequent investigation led to the conclusion that basically **every single completion SpaceUK has ever done is hacked**.

As Paqoe, a Pointercrate [Demon List](/posts/geometry-dash-demon-list-where-to-find-the-hardest-demons/) staff member, [proclaimed](https://twitter.com/zoe_bve/status/1651063152539488256):

> Using built-in watermarks from zBot, we have confirmed that nearly every list demon SpaceUK ever uploaded, starting from at least August 2021 (and likely March 2021), was botted, including Slaughterhouse and Sakupen Circles.

This means that notable Geometry Dash extreme demons, including Slaughterhouse, **were hack verified**. This also means SpaceUK lied in his first confession.

SpaceUK has since been banned from the Demon List, leading to Zoink becoming the new top 1 best Geometry Dash player.

_**Update on April 26, 12:07 AM EDT:** Added information about how SpaceUK is confirmed to have hacked virtually all his achievements, not just a few as was assumed before. This means he lied in his first confession._
