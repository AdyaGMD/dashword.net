The world's best Geometry Dash player, SpaceUK, has been exposed by the [Demon List leader](https://youtu.be/I2RTFwn_zho) for cheating his accomplishments.

This comes as a shock to the whole Geometry Dash community, especially since he got away with it for over a year.

In SpaceUK's confession, [he says](https://twitter.com/spadeuk/status/1650961282508419080):

> Every Main list after my Sephiroth mainlist completion in may 8th 2022 was hacked. I lost interest in actually playing the game and wanted to see how long i could go without being caught.

Notable demons SpaceUK cheated include [Kyouki](/posts/geometry-dash-kyouki-new-top-3-extreme-demon-explained/), [Abyss of Darkness](/posts/geometry-dash-levels-top-10-hardest-extreme-demons-2022/), [Acheron](/posts/breaking-acheron-takes-1-spot-on-geometry-dash-demonlist/).

SpaceUK has since been banned from the Demon List, leading to Zoink becoming the new top 1 best Geometry Dash player.
