After over a month since the release of [Geometry Dash 2.2](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-released/), RobTop has added the first new gauntlet: the **Castle Gauntlet**!

This gauntlet features the following levels:

1. CRUSH by Subwoofer
2. Glorious Fortress by JamAttack
3. Sky Tower by Rafer
4. CastleMania by Serponge
5. Still Life by Empika

This is the first new gauntlet. While [Geometry Dash 2.2 launched with some gauntlets](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-world-galaxy-universe-gauntlets/), they were already known before the update.
