Dashword has reached the milestone of 20,000 monthly readers! As just a small independent news source for a small independent game, this is incredible.

We are aware that 20,000 monthly readers is nothing compared to bigger publications that get tens of millions of readers every month. But for such a [small, independent, and open-source project](/about/), we are incredibly satisfied with these numbers.
