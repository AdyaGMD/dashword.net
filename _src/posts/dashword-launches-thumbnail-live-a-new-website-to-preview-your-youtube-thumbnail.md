On August 9, 2023, we launched [Thumbnail.live](https://www.thumbnail.live/), a new website to preview your YouTube thumbnail, title, and branding in a way near-identical to YouTube's.

While less Geometry Dash related, we still hid a bunch of Geometry Dash easter eggs on the site!

With Thumbnail.live, you can do the following:

- [Preview your title and thumbnail before posting your video](https://www.thumbnail.live/)
- [Preview your video on the YouTube homepage alongside other videos](https://www.thumbnail.live/feed/)
- [Preview your YouTube comments before you post them](https://www.thumbnail.live/comment/)
