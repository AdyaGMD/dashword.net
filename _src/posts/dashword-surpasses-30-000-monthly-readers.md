Dashword has recently surpassed 30,000 monthly readers. Nearly a year ago, [we only had 6000 monthly readers](/posts/dashword-has-surpassed-6000-monthly-readers/). In this time, we've quintupled our growth!

Since our last [Dashword reader report](/posts/dashword-gets-20000-monthly-readers/), we've done a lot.

- We've rewrote our [contribution guide](/contribute/) and improved the submission process! Now, it's easier than ever to submit your own articles! We have a very low denial rate so chances are your work will get accepted.
- We've [added courses to Dashword](/courses/)! You can also [submit your own course here](/contribute-courses/).

We're also interested in a Dashword Contribution Program where authors can get paid for their work. But as of now, contribution is still voluntary. If we do add a Contribution Program, we're unsure whether it will available to all or only frequent writers.

Thanks for reading Dashword! We hope to continue to provide the best Geometry Dash news for free.
