We recently put out an optional survey for our readers to fill out in order to help us improve our website. Here is what you told us and our plans for the future.

While this survey was 100% anonymous, we will not be releasing exact figures.

# How often do you visit Dashword? A lot, surprisingly.

Over 75% of survey respondents visit Dashword at least once a week. That is incredible! We were under the impression that we didn't have consistent readers, but new readers every month that come and go depending on their needs.

However, you have shown us that many of you read Dashword consistently. For the longest time, we've been sacrificing writing quality for richer information. We didn't believe that people cared to read our stuff on their own, but just wanted to get the necessary information and leave.

Now knowing that is not the case, we will do our best to increase the quality of our future articles for our consistent readers.

# What do you like to read from Dashword? Geometry Dash 2.2 news all the way.

Unsurprisingly, over 97% of respondents read our [Geometry Dash 2.2 news](/categories/2.2/). That makes sense due to the long-lasting hype for the update.

Aside from 2.2 news, over one third of respondents read our [Geometry Dash Demon List and extreme demon news](/categories/demonlist/). After that, you read our [opinions](/categories/opinion/) and our [guides](/categories/guide/).

But to our surprise, over 30% of respondents said they liked our [Geometry Dash quizzes](/quizzes/). These are silly quizzes that we occasionally put together for fun, but we assumed nobody liked them.

However, we have since [added a new quiz](/quizzes/geometry-dash-what-type-of-creator-are-you/) after learning that a lot of you do enjoy them.
