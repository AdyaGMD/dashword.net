One year ago today on February 1st, 2022, Dashword went live. Since then, there has been a lot of changes but our commitment has remained the same:

To provide the best Geometry Dash news for free.

In the span of a year, we've gone from 0 to 25,000 monthly readers! This is absolutely incredible and we cannot thank you enough.

The fact that such a small publication on a so-called small indie game can be this popular goes to show that Geometry Dash is far from dead.

But that's enough reminiscenceâ€”let's talk about what to look forward to in the future!
