One year ago today on February 1st, 2022, Dashword went live. Since then, there has been a lot of changes but our commitment has remained the same:

To provide the best Geometry Dash news for free.

In the span of a year, we've gone from [0 to 20,000 monthly readers](/about)! This is absolutely incredible and we cannot thank you enough.

The fact that such a small publication on a so-called small indie game can be this popular goes to show that Geometry Dash is far from dead.

But that's enough reminiscenceâ€”let's talk about what to look forward to in the future!

# Dashword Contribution Program

As we've [said before](/posts/dashword-gets-20000-monthly-readers/), we are actively considering a program to pay authors of content. While Dashword would remain open source, we believe that a portion of revenue deserves to go towards those who make the site possible: [our authors](/authors/).

# Geometry Dash 2.2 Is Closer Than You Think

RobTop continues to prove that [Geometry Dash 2.2 is right around the corner](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-news-everything-we-know-about-when-2-2-will-come-out/). We expect the update to come out this year for sure! You can read our [Geometry Dash 2.2 news](/categories/2.2/) for reassurance.

# New Audiences

Dashword continues to grow. Recently we hit [20,000 monthly readers](/posts/dashword-gets-20000-monthly-readers/), but we predict that number to go up this year.

All in all, Dashword's first year has been nothing but a success, and we can't wait for what is yet to come!
