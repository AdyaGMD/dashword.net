RobTop Games has confirmed that the second [Geometry Dash 2.2 sneak peek level](/posts/watch-all-geometry-dash-2-2-sneak-peeks-full-videos/), Explorers, will be delayed until after 2.2.

RobTop said this will be done in order to meet the [October 31st deadline for Geometry Dash 2.2](/posts/final-geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-confirmed-by-robtop/), meaning he [might actually get the update out this time](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-might-get-delayed-to-after-october/).

![RobTop says Explorers is being delayed to 2.21, which is after 2.2.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F7tfqtoXwAAZ5SC?format=png&name=small)

According to RobTop, Explorers needed some rework that he won't be able to do in time for the 2.2 release date, hence why it is being delayed.

While Explorers is being delayed, Dash, [the first Geometry Dash 2.2 sneak peek level](/posts/sneak-peek-recreation/), will be released with update 2.2.
