While Dashword largely dominates the web space for Geometry Dash news, GD Today is the largest Twitter source for Geometry Dash news, with over 25,000 followers. Despite this, the official account has remained unverified.

However, some time ago, a fake GD Today account popped up on Twitter. But unlike the others that don't last very long or garner much attention, this impostor account has acquired 3,400 followers.

While this is a parody account and much of its posts are obviously not real, it occasionally posts rather-convincing news. I myself have seen numerous people—including my own friends—get deceived by this account.

However, what baffles everyone is the fact that this account got verified.
