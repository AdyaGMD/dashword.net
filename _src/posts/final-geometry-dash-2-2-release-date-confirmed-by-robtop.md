RobTop Games has confirmed a final release date for [Geometry Dash 2.2](/categories/2.2/). On the [10 year anniversary of Geometry Dash](/posts/will-geometry-dash-2-2-come-out-on-the-games-10-year-anniversary/), RobTop confirmed that update 2.2 would release in October of 2023.

While not giving a specific day, this is the first official release date, meaning Geometry Dash 2.2 will *very likely* release in this month.

While it is possible RobTop will miss this release date, that is very unlikely.

That being said, after [over 6 years of waiting for 2.2](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-wait-turns-6-years-old/), we have a release date. Just not a *release day*.

Nonetheless, this is incredible news and cannot be understated.

This will hopefully be the final time we ask, but: what is the first thing you'll do once the update is released?
