RobTop Games released the third and final Geometry Dash 2.2 sneak peek on May 15, 2023. It makes heavy use of a new sound effect trigger.

You can [watch all three Geometry Dash 2.2 sneak peeks with this link](/posts/watch-all-geometry-dash-2-2-sneak-peeks-full-videos/).

Earlier, RobTop said that [sound effects would be saved for Geometry Dash 2.3](/posts/robtop-says-geometry-dash-2-2-platformer-mode-will-start-to-really-shine-in-2-3/) instead of 2.2. But this new sneak peek shows that he changed his mind and added sound effects to update 2.2.

![RobTop saying he wasn't originally going to add sound effects to 2.2 but did it anyway.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/392087938239954950/1107934252919685120/image.png?width=789&height=158)

However, this raises some controversy. [Geometry Dash 2.2 has been in the works for over 6 years](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-wait-turns-6-years-old/), mainly because RobTop keeps adding new features that he says he won't.

RobTop also said that this will be the last preview before Geometry Dash 2.2 finally releases. With this, we can expect update 2.2 to release within the next couple months, maybe even within just a few weeks.
