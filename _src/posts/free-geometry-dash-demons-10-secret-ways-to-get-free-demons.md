With these free demons with secret ways, you can get up to 50 free stars in Geometry Dash! These stars go towards your total count to unlock icons, ships, UFOs, and more.

Geometry Dash [demons are the hardest difficulty levels in the game](/posts/geometry-dash-demon-list-what-are-the-top-extreme-demons-2022/). Upon completing one, you get 10 stars, a demon towards your total demon count, [500 orbs](/posts/geometry-dash-how-to-get-mana-orbs-easy/) (which equivalates to a [demon key](/posts/geometry-dash-how-to-get-demon-keys-easy/)), and potentially other rewards such as icons and colors depending on how many total demons you have.

However, since these levels are so difficult, [they are not easy to beat](/posts/geometry-dash-levels-top-10-hardest-extreme-demons-2022/). Fortunately, these 5 demons have secret ways making them essentially free. (And they're **not patched!**)

You can use these 5 free demons and their IDs listed in brackets to get 50 free stars.

# SUPERCHARGE by Elvii (83388701)

SUPERCHARGE is an easy demon by Elvii. Fortunately, using a secret way, you can skip the entire level at just 14%.

Jump over the yellow jump pad at 14%. After that, the level is completely free.

See this [video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/w0iDFpz0Ifk) for help.

# ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRS by NeoSweet (45932196)

Ignore its elaborate name, as this secret way is incredibly easy to access.

Simply jump over the blue pad at 13% to access the secret way and beat the level.

The timing is a little tricky, so we recommend you try it in practice mode first. Here is a [video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/FNRqTqxRMMU).

# Midnight Sun by RoWeY (13609726)

Midnight sun is a little harder, being an insane demon. But fortunately, it has a secret way at just 24%.

Simply jump into the indivisible teleport portal at the end of the auto blue orb part, or at 24%. With this, the rest of the level will be free.

# Sundivine by Softable (10481669)

Sundivine is a hard demon, but with a secret way at 41%.

During the blue pads at 41%, start jumping as the UFO once you're upside down to go below the pads. Afterwards, jump 3 more times to go below the cube portal. The rest of the level is then free!

# Ice Hell Escape by MineMario (481354)

This old demon has a secret way at 42%. After that, there are a few obstacles to avoid at 61%, but then the rest of the level is free.

At 42%, take the lower ball path. Avoid a few spikes and you will fall to the ground. After a few seconds, a yellow pad will put you in a circle of portals. Time the yellow orb to go into the ship portal and avoid a saw. Avoid a few more obstacles and the rest of the level after 61% will be free.
