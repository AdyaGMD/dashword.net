# SUPERCHARGE by Elvii (83388701)

SUPERCHARGE is an easy demon by Elvii. Fortunately, using a secret way, you can skip the entire level at just 14%.

Jump over the yellow jump pad at 14%. After that, the level is completely free.

# ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRS by NeoSweet

Ignore its elaborate name, as this secret way is incredibly easy to access.

Simply jump over the blue pad at 13% to access the secret way and beat the level.
