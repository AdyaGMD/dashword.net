The term "Geometry Dash 2.2 Beta" has been thrown around quite a lot. But what does it really mean?

Geometry Dash 2.2 Beta is used to describe methods of getting early access to Geometry Dash 2.2. This includes using the [2.2 Geometry Dash Private Server](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-editor-unlocked-how-to-get-the-2-2-level-editor-2022/), or abusing bugs to access 2.2 content from any of the following updated games:

- Geometry Dash SubZero 
- Geometry Dash Lite
- Geometry Dash Meltdown
- Geometry Dash World

Each of the above games feature different versions of Geometry Dash 2.2, with Geometry Dash SubZero featuring the most up-to-date version.

In fact, not all of the 2.2 features in these games are hidden!

Some of the intentionally accessible 2.2 features in Geometry Dash SubZero include:

- New icon and color selection menu
- New portal textures
- New options
