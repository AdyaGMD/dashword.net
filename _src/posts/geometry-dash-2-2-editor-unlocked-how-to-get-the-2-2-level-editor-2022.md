The Geometry Dash 2.2 editor has become available after modders restored it from Geometry Dash Lite, Meltdown, SubZero, and World. With this, they have made the beta Geometry Dash 2.2 editor available.

But first, its important to note that this is not the official 2.2 update, [as we've covered before](/posts/how-to-get-the-2-2-editor/). What most people are using to try out the 2.2 editor is a **Geometry Dash Private Server (GDPS)** called **GDPS Editor.**

The latest version of GDPS Editor uses the latest version of 2.2, which is from Geometry Dash Lite. It contains the following 2.2 features, among many others:

* Swing copter
* Platformer mode
* Camera controls
* Reverse controls
* Arrow trigger
