The Geometry Dash 2.2 editor has become available after modders restored it from Geometry Dash Lite, Meltdown, SubZero, and World. With this, they have made the beta Geometry Dash 2.2 editor available.

But first, its important to note that this is not the official 2.2 update, [as we've covered before](/posts/how-to-get-the-2-2-editor/). What most people are using to try out the 2.2 editor is a **Geometry Dash Private Server (GDPS)** called **GDPS Editor.**

We've written an article on this before, so [check that out for more information](/posts/how-to-get-the-2-2-editor/). What you are reading now is an updated guide on how to install the 2.2 private server, GDPS Editor.
