Today, RobTop Games made a statement saying [Geometry Dash 2.2](/categories/2.2/) "is about to be completely finished for release."

In specific, [he said this](https://twitter.com/RobTopGames/status/1728817360901935570):

> Progress update: All levels and major bugfixing are done, so update 2.2 is about to be completely finished for release. However, since I want to release it at nearly the same time for App Store, Google Play, and Steam, it may not be doable in November due to varying review times.

With this, we can expect Geometry Dash 2.2 to release in early December 2023.

RobTop did not specifically say that the update was already sent out to Steam, Apple, and Google Play, meaning he likely has yet to formally finish and send the update for review.

Upon review from Steam, Apple, and Google Play, Geometry Dash 2.2 will be ready and released.
