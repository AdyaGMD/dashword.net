Despite saying that [Geometry Dash 2.2 would release in Early December](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-is-finished-release-scheduled-for-early-december/), RobTop Games might delay the update to 2024.

With the month halfway over and still [not a word from RobTop](/posts/robtop-will-release-geometry-dash-2-2-with-no-warning/), it is becoming increasingly likely that [Geometry Dash 2.2](/categories/2.2/) might be delayed to January 2024 or even later.

Not to mention that, from the looks of it, [RobTop hasn't even finished update 2.2](/posts/robtop-has-seemingly-not-even-submitted-geometry-dash-2-2-to-stores-for-review/) despite saying it was "about to be completely finished for release" back in November.

That being said, its hard to prove anything given the total lack of transparency between RobTop and the community. With RobTop being silent and Viprin taking some time off after [his recent controversy](/posts/geometry-dash-elder-moderator-viprin-responds-to-allegations-about-blackmail-spyware-and-inappropriate-encounters/), there is very little 2.2 news to be heard.

While [Viprin said he knows what is going on](/posts/robtop-will-release-geometry-dash-2-2-with-no-warning/), he refuses to tell the Geometry Dash community anything, stating that "it's not [his] place to announce anything."

Although Viprin did suggest that the reason RobTop is silent is so that update 2.2 can be released as a surprise, Viprin came short of absolutely confirming this.

That being said, Dashword's ongoing theory is that RobTop is still working on Geometry Dash 2.2, likely so that he can give himself the rest of the month to finish it.

Another reason for the wait could be that Apple, Google, or Steam has denied the update and is asking for RobTop to make changes.

For now, let's hope RobTop gives us some news soon. If the update gets delayed to 2024, that will mark its third delay in three months.
