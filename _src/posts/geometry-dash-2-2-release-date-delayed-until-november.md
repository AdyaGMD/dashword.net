In a [not so surprising move](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-likely-to-be-delayed-due-to-server-issues/), RobTop Games has officially delayed the [Geometry Dash 2.2](/categories/2.2/) release date from October 2023 to November 2023.

{% alert %}
Geometry Dash 2.2 has since been delayed again to Early December 2023. Fortunately, RobTop has confirmed that this time, the update is about finished! [Read the story here](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-is-finished-release-scheduled-for-early-december/).
{% endalert %}

Surprisingly, the Geometry Dash community has taken this news well.

Ultimately, this is very disappointing news. While the community should hold RobTop accountable, hate will go nowhere and is unnecessary.

While RobTop said on Twitter (now X) that he intends to release update 2.2 in November, he failed to show this in the [Geometry Dash 2.2 Trailer](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-trailer-released-by-robtop/) that he also uploaded today, which could show a lack of confidence.

Let's hope he isn't wrong this time and can finally release the update that we've been waiting [over 6 years for](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-wait-turns-6-years-old/)!
