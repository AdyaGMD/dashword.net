Today, RobTop Games has released some very unfortunate news. In a statement on the [official Geometry Dash Discord server](/posts/geometry-dash-discord-server-how-to-join-request-levels/), RobTop said that he will likely have to release [Geometry Dash 2.2](/categories/2.2/) in November, instead of the [previously promised release date of October 2023](/posts/final-geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-confirmed-by-robtop/).

This is very disappointing but will ensure that update 2.2 is in a playable state when it does release.

RobTop attributed the delay to server issues from when he [migrated Geometry Dash's servers to prepare for update 2.2](/posts/geometry-dash-servers-down-for-maintenance-pending-2-2/).

The last thing RobTop said implies that there is a strong chance [Geometry Dash 2.2 will be delayed until November](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-might-get-delayed-to-after-october/).

In other news, RobTop confirmed that he plans to release Geometry Dash 2.2 on all platforms at the same time, which is unlike what he has done for all past updates.
