On September 27, 2023, RobTop Games confirmed on the [Geometry Dash Discord server](/posts/geometry-dash-discord-server-how-to-join-request-levels/) that [Geometry Dash 2.2](/categories/2.2/) might be delayed to after October 2023, [the release date he gave in August](/posts/final-geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-confirmed-by-robtop/).

In a response to someone asking whether or not 2.2 will release in October, RobTop said October was what he was "aiming for."

![RobTop says he might delay the Geometry Dash 2.2 release date.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F7NCRI4W0AEoqDl?format=png&name=small)

This statement lacks confidence, especially seeing as he gave us a final release date of October 2023 over a month prior.

However, unlike previous release dates, which were more of suggestions, this one was announced in an official RobTop Games [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/mWi_zuXBECw?si=qAfQ8NBWUJsssLQA) with over 4 million views. To back out on this release date would understandably leave the Geometry Dash community furious.

Needless to say, if RobTop wants to keep any credibility, he has to release Geometry Dash 2.2 this month. But seeing as he lacks the confidence to do so, Geometry Dash 2.2 might be delayed until November or even further.
