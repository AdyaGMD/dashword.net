RobTop Games, the Geometry Dash developer, has confirmed that Geometry Dash 2.2 should release within February to June, 2023. This means update 2.2 could be less than 6 months away!

- RobTop originally confirmed a release date of 2022.
- Due to complications with the free demo versions of Geometry Dash, RobTop had to delay update 2.2.
- Now, RobTop has confirmed that he wants the Geometry Dash 2.2 release date to be February to June 2023.


That being said, RobTop has missed out on his promises before, like when he said [Geometry Dash 2.2 would release in 2022](/posts/2-2-release-date-confirmed/).

This time, however, instead of giving a release date of the whole year, he specifically says he could get it done within just the first half of 2023.

While he hopes for 2.2 to come out this early, it's entirely possible that he will have misjudged the time needed to finish the update again.

RobTop said that the reason he couldn't finish Geometry Dash 2.2 in 2022 is because of the [free games needing to be updated](https://www.dashword.net/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-confirmed-2023/) due to new Apple and Google store policies.

This also led to a bunch of [Geometry Dash 2.2 leaks](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-editor-unlocked-how-to-get-the-2-2-level-editor-2022/), including the [Geometry Dash 2.2 private server](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-private-server-download-install/) known as GDPS Editor or Blaze GDPS.
