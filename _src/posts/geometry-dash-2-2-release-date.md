Geometry Dash developer RobTop confirmed earlier that the Geometry Dash 2.2 release date is this year, in 2022. However, with only 3 months left in the year and still no update, when will it really come out?

[A fan asked RobTop](/posts/2-2-release-date-confirmed/) in the Geometry Dash Discord server whether or not 2.2 will be out this year, to which RobTop replied "yes."

However, there has been much speculation around whether or not RobTop can actually meet this deadline for releasing Geometry Dash 2.2.

# When Will Geometry Dash 2.2 Really Come Out?

RobTop confirmed that he had planned to release Geometry Dash 2.2 in 2022, but it is likely that the update will need a little longer. Instead, **Geometry Dash 2.2 will likely come out between January and June 2023.**

While it is possible for RobTop to release Geometry Dash 2.2 before the end of the year, that is becoming more and more unrealistic as the days pass. Instead, I think this estimate is much more realistic.

# Why Is Geometry Dash 2.2 Taking So Long?

Geometry Dash 2.2 is taking so long because of the following features:

* Multiplayer Mode
* Platformer Mode
* The Arrow Trigger
* The 2.2 Editor

These features, along with their many bugs, are taking a long time to program. They also require major parts of Geometry Dash to be rewritten because they are so game-changing.

These 4 features are likely contributing to Geometry Dash 2.2's long wait time.

# Where Can I Play Geometry Dash 2.2?

While the official update is not out yet for the full version of the game, **Geometry Dash Lite**, **Geometry Dash Meltdown**, **Geometry Dash World**, and **Geometry Dash SubZero** have all been updated with Geometry Dash 2.2 features. These features include:

* New character selection UI
* New portal textures
* New options

However, by modding these versions of the game, the beta Geometry Dash 2.2 editor has been restored. While it is very buggy, [here are instructions to get the beta Geometry Dash 2.2 editor](/posts/how-to-get-the-2-2-editor/).

To summarize, **Geometry Dash 2.2 is likely coming out between January and June 2023** if not by the end of this year. But who knows? Maybe RobTop will surprise all of us and release the update before Christmas!
