After nearly 7 years, [Geometry Dash 2.2](/categories/2.2/) has been released by RobTop Games! The long-awaited update was released at precisely 8:28 PM EST on December 19.

The only reason this article is so late is because *even our staff wanted to play 2.2 right away!*

If you don't yet have the update installed, [here is how to install Geometry Dash 2.2 on iOS, Android, and PC](/posts/how-to-install-geometry-dash-2-2/).

We've been covering Geometry Dash 2.2 news for [nearly 2 years](/posts/how-to-get-the-2-2-editor/) at this point, but we are now finally retiring our [Geometry Dash 2.2 news category](/categories/2.2/). While it may receive some final additions, we do not plan to continue publishing articles in it anymore.

But just now, [we've created a brand new Geometry Dash 2.3 category](/categories/2.3/)! We already have some 2.3 news in it from what RobTop has already revealed.

Thanks for sticking with us during this nearly 7 year long wait for the update! We're just as excited to play the update as you are!
