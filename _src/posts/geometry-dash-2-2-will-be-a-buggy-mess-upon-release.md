I am very worried that [Geometry Dash 2.2](/categories/2.2/) is going to be a buggy mess of an update upon release.

One thing is clear: [RobTop did not give himself enough time to finish 2.2](/posts/robtop-announced-the-geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-in-the-worst-way-possible/). And that will be made very clear once the update finally drops.

RobTop has basically said that [he will release Geometry Dash 2.2 this month](/posts/robtop-confirms-geometry-dash-2-2-is-still-set-for-a-november-release-date/) unless a game breaking bug comes up.

![RobTop says he will only delay Geometry Dash 2.2 if "something really bad shows up."](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-ll1qLboAIIF-W?format=jpg&name=medium)

Unfortunately, this means that the update will likely release with a lot of annoying bugs that do not fit this definition.

And on top of all the bugs, the update will not be very polished at all.

With all this plus the lack of presets taken into consideration, I am afraid using the Geometry Dash 2.2 editor will be a pain. At least not without [7 years of practice](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-wait-turns-6-years-old/), which RobTop conveniently has.

Let's hope 2.21 will come out quick and fix these issues.
