I was worried RobTop wouldn't stick to his word after this concerning post on the [Geometry Dash Discord server](/posts/geometry-dash-discord-server-how-to-join-request-levels/):

![RobTop expresses doubt about releasing 2.2 on time.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F7NCRI4W0AEoqDl?format=png&name=small)

But now he seems to be taking things more seriously. Instead of adding content as time goes on, RobTop is now [removing](/posts/robtop-cancels-geometry-dash-2-2-versus-mode-after-6-years-of-development/) [content](/posts/explorers-delayed-until-after-geometry-dash-2-2/), which is great, as it means [2.2 will be more likely to come out on time](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-might-get-delayed-to-after-october/).

![RobTop says he is delaying Explorers to 2.21.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F7tfqtoXwAAZ5SC?format=png&name=small)

Historically, the Geometry Dash 2.2 development cycle went like this:

- Spend time on the update.
- Add more features to make the update less disappointing.
- Have to spend more time on the update as a result.
- Add more features to make the update less disappointing, and repeat.

The problem was [RobTop just kept adding new features](/posts/final-geometry-dash-2-2-sneak-peek-released-by-robtop-games/). He was able to do this because he never gave himself a deadline. However, that really hurt the game, as we've now gone over [6 years since the last update](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-wait-turns-6-years-old/).

But for the first time in the entire game's existence, RobTop seems to be sticking to a deadline. And this is fantastic. With a deadline, the cycle of adding more and more features forever won't happen. It will force RobTop to manage his time and carefully consider the features he wants to add.

I don't want to understate this. Doing this is
