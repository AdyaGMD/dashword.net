Geometry Dash 2.2 will be getting 3 new confirmed Gauntlets: the World Gauntlet, Galaxy Gauntlet, and Universe Gauntlet.

Due to the high amount of stunning entries to the World Gauntlet contest, RobTop decided to add the Galaxy Gauntlet in order to feature more amazing entries.

However, there were still other fan favourite entries that still wouldn't get included. So, the Universe Gauntlet was created.

# World Gauntlet

The World Gauntlet will be the easiest of the three Gauntlets. It was originally going to feature the top 5 winning entries:

1. Asadal by Seokso and more
2. Ruta Del Sol by TroxxP1 and more
3. Koenigstein by Woom and more
4. Planet X by Arb and more
5. Frostburn Peak by AbstractDark and more

However, RobTop and the judges didn't feel it was fair to exclude the top 6-10. So, the Galaxy Gauntlet was created.

# Galaxy Gauntlet

The Galaxy Gauntlet will be harder than the World Gauntlet but easier than the Universe Gauntlet. It was originally going to consist of the 5 hardest levels in the top 10 winning entries:

1. Asadal by Seokso and more
2. Ruta Del Sol by TroxxP1 and more
3. Koenigstein by Woom and more
4. Planet X by Arb and more
5. Frostburn Peak by AbstractDark and more
6. Caput Mindi by RoyalP and more
7. Xanadu by Mangosteen and more
8. Nivel by melX0exe
9. Fizzy Fossils by Jghost and more
10. Down Unda by Danzmen and more

However, the Geometry Dash community thought that there were too many good entries to only include the top 10. So, the Universe Gauntlet was created.

# Universe Gauntlet

The Universe Gauntlet will be the hardest of the three Gauntlets. It will include the hardest of the top 15 winning entries.

However, the [World Gauntlet contest results video](https://youtu.be/IsJMpN7T8cY) did not provide the top 11-15 spots. However, Viprin, the main host of the contest, confirmed in the [Geometry Dash Discord server](https://discord.gg/geometrydash) that BISMARCK, Lutetia, and PABRIK will make it into the Gauntlets.

>  RobTop and I have heard everyone's disappointment about some of the entries from the **World Gauntlet Contest** not getting into 2.2 Gauntlets, so we'll be doing another one to get 11th to 15th place in as well. [...] Levels such as BISMARCK, Lutetia, and PABRIK will make it in with this change.

He also went on to share the graphics for the World Gauntlet, Galaxy Gauntlet, and Universe Gauntlet.
