RobTop Games revealed Geometry Dash 2.207 news while teasing an official multiplayer mode and Click Between Frames feature.

As always, RobTop gave us this [Geometry Dash 2.207 news](/categories/2.2/) in the [official Geometry Dash Discord server](/posts/geometry-dash-discord-server-how-to-join-request-levels/).

# Geometry Dash 2.207 Features

Geometry Dash 2.207 will fix Ignore Damage not working and fix issues with Windows Borderless mode. The update will also feature minor improvements and bug fixes.

# Official Multiplayer Update

RobTop expressed interest in creating an official multiplayer feature [like the Globed multiplayer mod for Geode](/posts/geometry-dash-multiplayer-how-to-download-and-install/).

While this is likely a long ways away, this might be a good replacement for [Versus Mode](/posts/robtop-cancels-geometry-dash-2-2-versus-mode-after-6-years-of-development/), as Versus Mode does not allow you to see other players.

# Official Click Between Frames Feature

RobTop also said he started making his own Click Between Frames feature for the game. However, RobTop said that this addition to the game is not confirmed, as he has not yet tested it on all devices.

RobTop also confirmed it will not work the same way as the current [Click Between Frames mod for Geode](/posts/geometry-dash-click-between-frames-mod-download-and-install/), but it will be similar.
