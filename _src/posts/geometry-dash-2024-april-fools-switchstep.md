The creator of Dash Full Version, SwitchstepGD, is currently creating a fanmade recreation of the [official Geometry Dash 2.2 level, Explorers](/posts/explorers-delayed-until-after-geometry-dash-2-2/).

After weeks of waiting, on April 1st, 2024, a live YouTube video premiere of what was supposedly his Explorers remake was published. From the thumbnail, it looked to be an extended version of the [official level that was previewed by RobTop Games](/posts/geometry-dash-new-sneak-peek-analysis/).

As this was published on April 1st, it's easy to shrug it off as an April Fools prank. **But is it?**

Perhaps this thumbnail is actually a preview for SwitchstepGD's Explorers remake. Maybe it's an Explorers Full Version?

Before the premiere, the level, with an ID of 103371298, was released. The level just contains regular Explorers, and with a "Happy April Fools!" message at the end.

The same is true for the live YouTube premiere. After the level ended, a message saying "Happy April Fools!" fills the screen for the remainder of the 10 hour video.

However, there is hidden morse code beneath this message. Here is what it looks like after you turn up the exposure and crop it:

This morse code translates to the following:

> EXPLORERS SALDRÅ EL DMA 10 DE ABRIL ELEASEN ON APRIL 10 DES EKPLORATEURS SORTIRONT LE 1# AURIL EDPRORERS WYJDUT 10 APRELÆ.

When translated from Spanish to English on Google Translate, it reads as follows:

> EXPLORERS WILL BE OUT ON DMA 10 APRIL ELEASEN ON APRIL 10 DES EKPLORATEURS SORTIRONT LE 1# AURIL EDPRORERS WYJDUT 10 APRELÆ

The message is still not perfectly clear, but the point is obvious. Does this mean that SwitchstepGD's extended Explorers will come out on April 10th? Only time will tell. Unless of course, you're reading this after the fact.

At the end of the premiere, a Dash mix can be heard instead of Sneaky Snitch. In a reply to a comment I posted on the video, music producer DestroyerBoyGD stated that him and a friend created it.

Likewise, another player, GD Sayori, got a message from SwitchstepGD saying not to create another Dash mega mix, meaning this Dash mix might be used for something by SwitchstepGD. Again, only time will tell.
