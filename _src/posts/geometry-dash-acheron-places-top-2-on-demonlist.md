Geometry Dash Acheron, the supposed top 1 hardest extreme demon, has placed #2 on the Pointercrate demonlist following controversial decision by the list moderators.

After being verified one month ago on August 22, 2022, the said-to-be top 1 hardest level in Geometry Dash, Acheron, has fell short of expectations after being placed at the #2 spot [below Slaughterhouse](/posts/geometry-dash-slaughterhouse-top-1).

# Demon List Controversy

This controversial placement has caused much backlash from the Geometry Dash community, with people saying "[list ruined](https://twitter.com/fakedenni/status/1574607466460901377)" and that "[the list team [is] out here showing their bias once again](https://twitter.com/prolix64_/status/1574609492083412993)."

The [Demon List responded in saying](https://twitter.com/demonlistgd/status/1574606906668490752):

> Due to a lack of reliable opinions, this placement is highly subject to change.

Another thing to note is that the [ongoing Demon List controversy as of late](/posts/geometry-dash-the-problem-with-the-demonlist/) is likely playing a role in the Geometry Dash community's backlash.

It is also worth noting that this situation is much similar to [what happened to the top 5 extreme demon Mayhem](/posts/geometry-dash-mayhem-places-top-10-in-demonlist/), which suffered a similar fate.
