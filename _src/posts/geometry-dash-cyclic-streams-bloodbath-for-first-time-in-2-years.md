Popular Geometry Dash legend Cyclic [did his first stream in 2 years](https://youtu.be/vT6_X8otku8), playing the infamous level "Bloodbath" by Riot and more.

Cyclic was a popular player over 5 years ago in the 1.9 and 2.0 updates. However, it appears the Geometry Dash community still remembers him, given how [GD Today's news report](https://twitter.com/today_gd/status/1568999844840181760) got over 2500 likes.

But there is one question everyone is asking: **will Cyclic return to Geometry Dash?**

# Will Cyclic Return To Geometry Dash?

This is something the Geometry Dash community seems to be hoping, given how many comments on the stream are excited for his return. However, **Cyclic might not be returning to Geometry Dash.**

It is common for former Geometry Dash players to occasionally pick up the game again for fun, but leave not long after. **This might be the case with Cyclic, as there is no promise that he is going to stick around.**

That being said, [Cyclic's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Cyclic98) has since uploaded two videos and [streamed for 5 hours](https://youtu.be/nf5U0tyoU1Y) 9 days ago.

So who knows? Could this be the return of Geometry Dash legend Cyclic, or is this just a temporary comeback?
