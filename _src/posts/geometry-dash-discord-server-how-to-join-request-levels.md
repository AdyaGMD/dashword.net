1. Create a new Discord server just for yourself and anyone else you want to invite.
2. Follow the #lvl-req-streams channel and set it to send announcements to your newly created Discord server.
3. Turn notifications on for your newly created Discord server if they are not already on.
4. W﻿hen you get a notification from #lvl-req-streams in your newly created Discord server, use the link sent to join the level request stream.
5. Follow the instructions the streamer gives to request your level.
