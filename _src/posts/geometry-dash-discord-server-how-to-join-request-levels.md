The Geometry Dash Discord server is home of the Geometry Dash community and the developer RobTop Games. RobTop occasionally leaks Geometry Dash 2.2 news there.

This is where you want to be if you ever want to see RobTop live and chatting. It is also the game's main area for support with account issues and other questions.

3. Follow the instructions onscreen to verify yourself.

# H﻿ow To Request Your Geometry Dash Levels

Unfortunately, the Geometry Dash Discord server directly no longer takes level requests. However, there is a channel where Geometry Dash mod level request streams are announced as they happen.

Here is how to request your Geometry Dash levels:

1. Create a new Discord server just for yourself and anyone else you want to invite.
2. Follow the #lvl-req-streams channel and set it to send announcements to your newly created Discord server.
3. Turn notifications on for your newly created Discord server if they are not already on.
4. W﻿hen you get a notification from #lvl-req-streams in your newly created Discord server, use the link sent to join the level request stream.
5. F﻿ollow the instructions the streamer gives to request your level.
