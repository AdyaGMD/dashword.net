What started as a rather uneventful day is now ending with the head Geometry Dash Elder Moderator, Viprin, being accused of... well, a lot of things.

Let's start from the top.

1. Viprin is accused of blackmailing a [Geometry Dash 2.2](/categories/2.2/) leaker
2. Viprin is exposed for using Discord bots to spy on mod chat leakers
3. Viprin is exposed for being 21 years old and dating a 16 year old girl
4. The person who exposed Viprin for dating a 16 year old apparently did this to hurt the "victim" by leaking her personal information
5. There are potentially many other accusations against Viprin for leaking private information and holding onto private information to use as blackmail

Thanks to [this Twitter/X user](https://twitter.com/im_eao/status/1731869938791383203) for summarizing some of this situation.

Dashword will keep the identities of the "victim" and the leaker private in this article.

These are some very serious accusations, and as a result, will require much proof to back up these claims.

This is very much a developing situation, and as such, Dashword cannot verify many of the claims being made.

Viprin has yet to share his side of the story for many of these accusations, but others close to him have already vouched for him.

[Pauze](https://twitter.com/pauzegd/status/1731863395673010496) claims that despite Viprin dating someone 5 years younger than him, that is legal in the countries where they live. Whether or not it was moral depends on your personal beliefs. Also according to Pauze, this relationship has been cut off "some time ago."

Likewise, there are claims that the person who leaked Viprin's relationship did so out of malice.

Viprin has made some responses denying the use of his bot, Sparky, to spy on users. But he has yet to comment about the use of UltimateGDBot to spy on mod chat leakers.

Once again, this is very much a developing situation, so things said here might get outdated very fast. [Keep an eye on our news](/posts/) for future updates to this situation.

Right now, please wait for all sides to contribute before jumping to any conclusions. We will post more news once the situation develops further.
