T﻿he famous lost and forgotten Geometry Dash level Element 111 Rg by DarkX has been discovered on an old save file, but there's a catch.

T﻿he data that contains the actual level has been deleted, and all this discovery does is prove the level's existence, among other things.

T﻿hat being said, Restoration Union still calls this an [incredible discovery](https://twitter.com/Restoration_Uni/status/1578737984907935744):

> We found an old save file with 111 RG (no object data however), confirming that the song is Time Machine and also giving us DarkX's userID.
>
>
>
> Now we know 100% that DarkX used the name DarkM and made Theory Of Clutter as his only other known level.

> Thanks to everyone involved!
