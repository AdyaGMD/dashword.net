After being [unrated for containing stolen assets](/posts/geometry-dash-extreme-demon-natural-disaster-unrated-following-accusations/) nearly a year ago, Geometry Dash [top 10 extreme demon Natural Disaster](/posts/geometry-dash-top-10-level-natural-disaster-verified-by-helix/) has remained unrated.

Neither RobTop Games or any Geometry Dash moderators have commented on why the level hasn't been rated.

On November 7, 2022, popular Geometry Dash creator Culuc [revealed that Natural Disaster contained stolen assets](/posts/geometry-dash-extreme-demon-natural-disaster-unrated-following-accusations/#the-accusation), where at least some of which were his own.

Despite saying he believes the level should still be rated, RobTop unrated the level.

As a result of this, Natural Disaster was updated to remove the stolen assets. However, this level has still remained unrated for nearly a year.
