The hardest levels ever made in Geometry Dash are extreme demons and they are ranked on the Pointercrate demonlist. However, as of late, it has become incredibly controversial.

This started when many Geometry Dash YouTubers began expressing their criticisms about the demonlist and top 1 extreme demons overall. However, even in all the banter, the question still remains:

**What is the problem with the demonlist?**

What are people even arguing when they critique the demonlist? That is what I will be revealing in the rest of this article.

* [Demonlist Mentality]()
* [Extreme Demon Mentality]()

# The Geometry Dash Demonlist Problem

The Geometry Dash Demonlist problem is caused by the following:

* The mentality towards the demonlist
* The mentality towards extreme demons

But ultimately, **the problem with the demonlist is the monopolization of extreme demons.**

With the surge of demonlist discussion, many points have been argued. Much of these are fair critiques, but are far from being a central answer for the problem with the Geometry Dash demonlist. Instead, I believe the problem with the demonlist is **the mentality of the Geometry Dash community.**

# Demonlist Mentality

I have the utmost respect for the demonlist staff. They manage to work well despite the high expectations placed upon them by the Geometry Dash community. None of the problems with the demonlist or extreme demons is caused by them.

Instead, the problem is with the Geometry Dash community's *mentality* towards the demonlist.

As Geometry Dash YouTuber [Stormfly argues in his critique](), **the demonlist will never be accurate.** But the community's attitude towards it suggests that it is.

The truth is, the demonlist shouldn't be thought so highly of. It should be considered *one* ranking of the hardest levels, not *the only* ranking of the hardest levels.

However, this absolute mentality towards the demonlist is just the cause of the main problem with the demonlist: the mentality towards Geometry Dash extreme demons.

Instead, the demonlist should be, well *a list!* It should be seen as a list of the hardest demons, not an accurate ranking of the hardest demons.

Stormfly, in his critique, then goes on to argue that the GDDP (Geometry Dash Demon Progression) is a much better way to rate extreme demons. In the GDDP, levels are grouped by difficulty. There isn't a top 1 hardest level, but a top 1 group of the hardest levels.

# Extreme Demon Mentality

With the way the community sees the demonlist, one thing is clear: **the top 1 extreme demon isn't a level to be taken lightly.** Because of so, everyone wants to have their level in the top.

This has led to the monopolization of extreme demons.

Let's consider the top extreme demons from 2017 to the top extreme demons now (2022).

**Some top extreme demons in 2017:**

* Plasma Pulse Finale
* Erebus
* Digital Descent
* Yatagarasu

**Some top extreme demons in 2022:**

* Slaughterhouse
* Abyss of Darkness
* Firework
* Arcturus

Consider how diverse the top extreme demons in 2017 were. They consisted of many different styles and themes.

However, that has changed in 2022.

Nowadays, extreme demons have been monopolized. YouTubers, creators, and top players have learned that money and fame comes from making the top hardest extreme demon.

So, it becomes obvious: **making a good level doesn't bring in money and fame. Making the top 1 extreme demon does,** so why would you spend so much time and effort making it good when you could just recruit a team of glow creators to make it *alright* but *painfully average?*

**Back in the day, extreme demons weren't made for being the hardest.** Okay, I mean, *some likely were a little bit*—but still nowhere near the extent nowadays.

The top extreme demons were made by players to astound the community—not always in regards to difficulty, but even in regards to decoration and gameplay.

But as the community has begun viewing the Pointercrate demonlist to such a high standard, players began making extreme demons solely to top that. Extreme demons nowadays don't feature original ideas, concepts, and styles because they don't have to. They only need to be difficult.

Seriously—how many upcoming *original* top extreme demons can you think of? Personally, I think of **Limbo.** And that's about it.

**Ultimately: the top extreme demons were not solely made to be difficult, but to showcase incredible decoration from talented individuals. But now, they are made solely to be difficult, because the mentality the community has allows for it.**

People don't care about good extreme demons anymore. They only care about its difficulty. They don't care about the level. They care about the difficulty.
