Golden Gates is an upcoming Geometry Dash top 1 extreme demon. It is designed to be only barely humanly possible, which would make it the hardest level ever if verified.

This level is far beyond the skill level of today's players, a lot like [Silent Clubstep](/posts/what-is-silent-clubstep-geometry-dash/) was eight years ago.

If this ever gets verified, it will without a doubt place top 1 on the [Pointercrate Demon List](/posts/geometry-dash-demon-list-what-are-the-top-extreme-demons-2022/), the game's most accurate ranking of [Geometry Dash's hardest levels](/posts/geometry-dash-levels-what-is-the-hardest-level-ever-made/).

# Gameplay

The gameplay of Golden Gates is based heavily on that of [Silent Clubstep](/posts/geometry-dash-levels-top-10-hardest-extreme-demons-2022/#%234%3A-silent-clubstep) and [Slaughterhouse](/posts/geometry-dash-slaughterhouse-top-1/).

# Decoration

The decoration of Golden Gates is set to be based on VSC and The Golden. That being said, there is no previewed decoration at this time.

We will publish further Golden Gates news in our [Demon List category](/categories/demonlist/) once this changes.

# Release Date

Rhe current release date for Golden Gates is unknown as the level is still very early in development. We estimate, however, that it should take anywhere between 3-12 months from now.
