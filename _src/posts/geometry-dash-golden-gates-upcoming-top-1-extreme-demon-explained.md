Golden Gates is an upcoming Geometry Dash top 1 extreme demon. It is designed to be only barely humanly possible, which would make it the hardest level ever if verified.

This level is far beyond the skill level of today's players, a lot like [Silent Clubstep](/posts/what-is-silent-clubstep-geometry-dash/) was eight years ago.

If this ever gets verified, it will without a doubt place top 1 on the [Pointercrate Demon List](/posts/geometry-dash-demon-list-what-are-the-top-extreme-demons-2022/), the game's most accurate ranking of [Geometry Dash's hardest levels](/posts/geometry-dash-levels-what-is-the-hardest-level-ever-made/).
