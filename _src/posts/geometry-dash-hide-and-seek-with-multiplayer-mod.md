In this video, we played Hide and Seek in Geometry Dash with the [Globed multiplayer mod](/posts/geometry-dash-multiplayer-how-to-download-and-install/). You can watch Geometry Dash: Hide And Seek on YouTube now.

Watch the full video here: [I Played Hide And Seek In Geometry Dash](https://youtu.be/-LwbP63hMEE?si=NR0dxj5nHgkB4YQO).

Using the Globed multiplayer mod, we played Hide and Seek in Geometry Dash by creating a map for players to hide in. The last person to be found wins!

Making this video was very interesting because it allowed us to get a glimpse into what the future of Geometry Dash could hold if [multiplayer gets officially added](/posts/geometry-dash-needs-multiplayer-here-is-how-robtop-can-do-it/).
