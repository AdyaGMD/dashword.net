The Geometry Dash Chaos Gauntlet is required to free the demon guardian, which makes beating it crucial to progressing in the game. That being said, the Chaos Gauntlet will seem like a very difficult Gauntlet at first.

That being said, with a bit of help, completing all 5 levels will become a lot easier. This article aims to give you that help by providing tips to beat each level in the Chaos Gauntlet.

Here is a list of all five levels of the Chaos Gauntlet.

* [Anubis](#anubis)
* [Scarlet Surge](#scarlet-surge)
* [Drippy Dub](#drippy-dub)
* [Kappaclysm](#kappaclysm)
* [Dark Drop](#dark-drop)

# Anubis

Anubis is an easy start to the Chaos Gauntlet. It has simple design, making seeing where to go a lot easier. That being said, there are some things to look out for.

* Use practice mode. Complete the level a few times in practice mode before attempting it in normal mode.

* The dual part is symmetrical, meaning you only need to focus on one icon.

* In the last wave part, the black spikes on the top and bottom of the screen move to the beat of the music. Use practice mode to learn the rhythm so you don't get caught off guard.

# Scarlet Surge

Scarlet Surge is by far the most infamous Chaos Gauntlet level. Most of the time, the gameplay is hidden, making it very hard to see. However, while it may look intimidating due to how much is hidden, the gameplay is actually really easy once you learn it.

Just don't give up and keep trying. Do a practice run whenever you struggle to make progress and keep going. This is one of those levels were the only advice I can give is to practice!

Chances are, if you're stuck on any Chaos Gauntlet level, this is the one, so everything after this should be easy.

* Practice mode is **most essential** in this level. Because of how obscured the gameplay is, you should complete the level numerous times in practice mode to learn the route before trying it in normal mode.

* Scarlet Surge has a lot of tricky UFO sections. It requires precise timing, so either use practice mode to replay the UFO parts a lot or see the video walkthrough linked below.

# Drippy Dub

Drippy Dub is another easier level, so chances are you shouldn't struggle with it too much. But here are some helpful tips.

* The screen moves up and down a lot, which can make some parts hard to see. Complete the level multiple times in practice mode to learn this before trying it in normal mode.
* In the first part, some platforms move once you land on them. If you aren't careful, this can catch you off guard.

* Near the end, there is a dark part that is hard to see. Practice this part in practice mode so you know what to expect in normal mode.

# Kappaclysm

Like Scarlet Surge, Kappaclysm is one of the harder Chaos Gauntlet levels and at times can be hard to see. Fortunately, it is far more visible than Scarlet Surge.

* While easier to see, the gameplay is very hard. Use practice mode to learn how to complete each part.

* Near the end, there is a slow ball part that can be hard to see in. Before trying this part in normal mode, figure out where to go using practice mode. It might also be helpfult to watch the video linked below.

# Dark Drop

In Dark Drop, it is easy to see the platforms, but the screen is moving a lot so it can be hard to see which ones to use. It also has some of the hardest gameplay, similar to that of Kappaclysm.

* A lot of obstacles are off screen and easy to miss. Beat the level a few times in practice mode before trying it in normal mode so you don't fail to any of these.

* A lot of platforms and obstacles move erratically, making it hard to see what's ahead at times. Be prepared for these by using practice mode.

* Like Anubis, the dual parts in Dark Drop is symmetrical, so you only need to focus on one icon.
