iOS 16 has been confirmed to fix the infamous Geometry Dash crash bug that made the game unplayable. Now, players with an iPhone 8 or higher can update their iOS and play the game again.

While iOS 16 is not currently available for the iPad, beta testers say it also fixes the crash bug.

Several months ago, once iOS 15 was released, it was reported to crash Geometry Dash upon opening. While some devices were unaffected, many were. This made the game unplayable for a large portion of the community.

# How To Fix The Geometry Dash Crash Bug

Here is how to fix the Geometry Dash iOS 15 crash bug:

* **If on iPhone 8 or higher:** update to iOS 16.
