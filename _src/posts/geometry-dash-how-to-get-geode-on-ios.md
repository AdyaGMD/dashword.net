The Geometry Dash mod loader Geode is currently not available on iOS. Geode is a Geometry Dash mod loader for installing mods such as [Globed](/posts/geometry-dash-multiplayer-how-to-download-and-install/). While installing it on most platforms is easy, iPhone and iPad users have been baffled by the lack of iOS support.

As it stands right now, Apple makes modding applications very difficult on their devices. This is why Geode developers have found porting it to iOS to be very difficult.

This article will go over why Geode is not officially available on iOS and how iOS players can use Geode in other ways.

# Why Geode is not available on iOS

Geode developers have stated that right now, Geode support for iOS devices is not possible. They also clarified that the EU's upcoming sideloading laws won't help either.

In specific, a Geode developer clarified that "iOS doesn't allow some features other platforms do that are required for Geode."

That being said, another Geode developer said that Geode for iOS could be possible by jailbreaking the device. But due to jailbreaking being so uncommon, they said they will not make a jailbreak-exclusive solution.
