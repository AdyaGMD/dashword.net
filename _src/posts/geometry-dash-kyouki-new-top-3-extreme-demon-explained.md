The Geometry Dash level Kyouki is the current top 3 hardest extreme demon on the Pointercrate Demon List, the most popular ranking of Geometry Dash's hardest levels ever made.

However, Kyouki is unique from [most other top extreme demons](/posts/geometry-dash-demon-list-what-are-the-top-extreme-demons-2022/) for one simple reason: it was made by just one person.

Despite that, it is well-regarded as one of the best looking extreme demons in Geometry Dash.

The fact that we now have a solo level in the top 3 hardest extreme demons on the Demon List is crazy. Since good levels nowadays take so long to make, seeing Kyouki get the spotlight is well-deserved.
