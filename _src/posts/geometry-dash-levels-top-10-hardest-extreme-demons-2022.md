Geometry Dash is one of the hardest mobile platformers out there. While official levels like Deadlocked and Clubstep are hard, extreme demons like Slaughterhouse and Acheron are what only the most elite players even have a chance at completing.

Many people who've ever completed a top 10 extreme demon have put in **hundreds of thousands**  of attempts, making these levels the hardest levels ever made in Geometry Dash.

With that being said, what are the top 10 hardest extreme demons in Geometry Dash?

# #10: The Hallucination

The tenth hardest level in the game is The Hallucination by VoTcHi and SyQual. This is a dark blue and purple extreme demon that focuses mainly on the wave game mode, but with other game modes sprinkled in.

It [follows the Nine Circles level formula](/posts/history-of-nc-levels/), but only vaguely, making it a very unique and interesting top 10.

It's design is super cool looking, definitely making it one of the best extreme demons in the game.

# #9: Hard Machine

The ninth hardest level in the game is Hard Machine by Nikroplays, Viri and Komp. It features many vibrant colors and technical designs making it a very cool extreme demon.

This level also has a lot of history, being a modern remake of an old impossible level by the same name.

This level is a nice take on classic extreme demon gameplay with modern design!

# #8: Oblivion

The eight hardest level in the game is Oblivion by Benji8080 and more. This extreme demon is a traditional looking extreme demon that focuses on all game modes and skill types.

While it may not look as impressive as other extreme demons on the list, you cannot underestimate its difficulty.

This level is also the official Cognition sequel, which is another really difficult extreme demon, but not in the top 10 hardest.

# #7: Arcturus

The seventh hardest level in the game is Arcturus by Maxfs. This level used to be [one of the most impossible levels in the game](/posts/geometry-dash-levels-what-is-the-most-impossible-level-2022/), but it was nerfed so that it could get verified and [place on the Demon List](/posts/geometry-dash-demon-list-what-are-the-top-extreme-demons-2022/).

That being said, you cannot deny that it is still one of the hardest levels ever made in Geometry Dash, even in its nerfed state.

![Arcturus](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/392087938239954950/1037955685947809803/4K__Arcturus__NEW_TOP_1_by_maxFS_Extreme_Demon___Geometry_Dash_2.11_0-14_screenshot.png?width=1201&height=676)

*﻿Arcturus by Maxfs, screenshot from [Just a GD player](https://youtu.be/wHXFFnmMB1Q).*

Arcturus has a menacing red color scheme which we think fits the atmosphere of the level incredibly well. This is one of the hardest levels in the entire game.

# #6: Firework

The sixth hardest level in the game is Firework by Vernam and more. Unlike Arcturus that sticks to a clear red theme, this level is entirely grey.

F﻿irework is a super long, skill tester that is not easy to beat. It was the top 1 hardest level at one point, but has since fallen down the list as new levels were beaten.

That being said, do not underestimate this level's difficulty.

# #5: Sakupen Circles

The fifth hardest level in the game is Sakupen Circles by DrCuber and more. This is a level that mostly tests your skill with the wave game mode, featuring some of the hardest wave parts ever made in Geometry Dash.

Just like The Hallucination, this level [follows the Nine Circles level formula](/posts/history-of-nc-levels/), but a lot more strictly.

![Sakupen Circles](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/392087938239954950/1037957923084714004/ITS_VERIFIED___Sakupen_Circles_NEW_TOP_1_-_in_Perfect_Quality_4K_60fps_-_Geometry_Dash_0-26_screenshot.png?width=1201&height=676)

Despite the fact that it is a Nine Circles level, Sakupen Circles still has some really good decoration.

# #4: Silent Clubstep

# #3: Abyss of Darkness

# #2: Slaughterhouse

# #1: Acheron
