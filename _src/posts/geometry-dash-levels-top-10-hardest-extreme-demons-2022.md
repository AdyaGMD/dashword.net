Geometry Dash is one of the hardest mobile platformers out there. While official levels like Deadlocked and Clubstep are hard, extreme demons like Slaughterhouse and Acheron are what only the most elite players even have a chance at completing.

Many people who've ever completed a top 10 extreme demon have put in **hundreds of thousands**  of attempts, making these levels the hardest levels ever made in Geometry Dash.

With that being said, what are the top 10 hardest extreme demons in Geometry Dash?

# #10: The Hallucination

The tenth hardest level in the game is The Hallucination by VoTcHi and SyQual. This is a dark blue and purple extreme demon that focuses mainly on the wave game mode, but with other game modes sprinkled in.

It [follows the Nine Circles level formula](/posts/history-of-nc-levels/), but only vaguely, making it a very unique and interesting top 10.

It's design is super cool looking, definitely making it one of the best extreme demons in the game.

# #9: Hard Machine

The ninth hardest level in the game is Hard Machine by Nikroplays, Viri and Komp. It features many vibrant colors and technical designs making it a very cool extreme demon.

This level also has a lot of history, being a modern remake of an old impossible level by the same name.

![Hard Machine](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/392087938239954950/1037953460299112478/VERIFIED_Hard_Machine_-_Former_Top_1_-_by_komp_-_https___pastebin.com_BPCs2EGe_1-4_screenshot.png?width=1201&height=676)

This level is a nice take on classic extreme demon gameplay with modern design!

# #8: Oblivion

The eight hardest level in the game is Oblivion by Benji8080 and more. This extreme demon is a traditional looking extreme demon that focuses on all game modes and skill types.

While it may not look as impressive as other extreme demons on the list, you cannot underestimate its difficulty.

![Oblivion](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/392087938239954950/1037954823791857664/Verification_Oblivion_by_Benji__More_100_Official_Cognition_Sequel_0-50_screenshot.png?width=1201&height=676)

*﻿Oblivion by Benji8080 and more, screenshot from [Dice88](https://youtu.be/ZcmDAm50BB0).*

This level is also the official Cognition sequel, which is another really difficult extreme demon, but not in the top 10 hardest.

# #7: Arcturus

The seventh hardest level in the game is Arcturus by Maxfs. This level used to be [one of the most impossible levels in the game](/posts/geometry-dash-levels-what-is-the-most-impossible-level-2022/), but it was nerfed so that it could get verified and [place on the Demon List](/posts/geometry-dash-demon-list-what-are-the-top-extreme-demons-2022/).

That being said, you cannot deny that it is still one of the hardest levels ever made in Geometry Dash, even in its nerfed state.

![Arcturus](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/392087938239954950/1037955685947809803/4K__Arcturus__NEW_TOP_1_by_maxFS_Extreme_Demon___Geometry_Dash_2.11_0-14_screenshot.png?width=1201&height=676)

*﻿Arcturus by Maxfs, screenshot from [Just a GD player](https://youtu.be/wHXFFnmMB1Q).*

Arcturus has a menacing red color scheme which we think fits the atmosphere of the level incredibly well. This is one of the hardest levels in the entire game.

# #6: Firework

The sixth hardest level in the game is Firework by Vernam and more. Unlike Arcturus that sticks to a clear red theme, this level is entirely grey.

F﻿irework is a super long, skill tester that is not easy to beat. It was the top 1 hardest level at one point, but has since fallen down the list as new levels were beaten.

![Firework](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/392087938239954950/1037956805629857852/Firework__by_cherry_team___TOP_1_Extreme_Demon_4K_SHOWCASE_1-38_screenshot.png?width=1201&height=676)

*﻿Firework by Vernam and more, screenshot from [Just a GD player](https://youtu.be/8RcZVS0kzCg).*

That being said, do not underestimate this level's difficulty.

# #5: Sakupen Circles

We're now entering the top 5! The fifth hardest level in the game is Sakupen Circles by DrCuber and more. This is a level that mostly tests your skill with the wave game mode, featuring some of the hardest wave parts ever made in Geometry Dash.

Just like The Hallucination, this level [follows the Nine Circles level formula](/posts/history-of-nc-levels/), but a lot more strictly.

![Sakupen Circles](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/392087938239954950/1037957923084714004/ITS_VERIFIED___Sakupen_Circles_NEW_TOP_1_-_in_Perfect_Quality_4K_60fps_-_Geometry_Dash_0-26_screenshot.png?width=1201&height=676)

*﻿Sakupen Circles by by DrCuber and more, screenshot from [Neiro](https://youtu.be/b66_Oe4Xo1w).*

Despite the fact that it is a Nine Circles level, Sakupen Circles still has some really good decoration.

# #4: Silent Clubstep

The fourth hardest level in the game is Silent Clubstep TheRealSalient. This level was an old impossible level by TheRealSalient and was so hard that it was believed that it could never be beaten.

But seven years later, somebody beat it, making [Geometry Dash history in the process](/categories/history/).

![Silent Clubstep](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/392087938239954950/1037959033207922808/SILENT_CLUBSTEP__VERIFIED_LEGENDARY_DEMON_0-10_screenshot.png?width=1201&height=676)

*﻿Silent Clubstep by TheRealSailent, screenshot from [Paqoe](https://youtu.be/GR4OMkS3SN8).*

This part (pictured above) is one of the hardest parts by far. It is a very tight ship corridor and takes tens of thousands of attempts to master. Not to mention the fact that you can barely see it.

In fact, there is a player called [Vision](https://youtu.be/CeguDFtYl1o) who has put over 650,000 attempts into the level. All this, and and yet there are still three harder levels.

# #3: Abyss of Darkness

We're now entering the top 3! The third hardest level in the game is Abyss of Darkness by Exen and more. This is a modern remake of an older level by the same name that was hack verified.

But for the remake, it was verified legitimately, making it the third hardest level ever beaten.

![Abyss of Darkness](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/392087938239954950/1037965441286557767/IMG_0448.png)

*Abyss of Darkness by Exen and more, screenshot from [Neiro](https://youtu.be/zjJCqqV2410).*

The level features many dark colors, forming this gloomy atmospherel which is a very cool theme for a top 3 extreme demon.

# #2: Slaughterhouse

The second hardest level in the game is Slaughterhouse by Endlevel and more. This level was once [stuck at the top 1 spot for almost a year](/posts/geometry-dash-slaughterhouse-top-1/), but has since [finally fallen off](/posts/breaking-acheron-takes-1-spot-on-geometry-dash-demonlist/) after a long rule at the top.

As is evident by this level's long rule as the hardest level in Geometry Dash, this extreme demon is one to be feared.

*Slaughterhouse by Endlevel and more, screenshot from [KrX](https://youtu.be/MQVvbcIf0Es).*

While this level is no longer top 1, it is still of an unimaginable difficulty.

# #1: Acheron

The hardest level ever made in Geometry Dash is Acheron by GrenadeOfTacos and more. It is a Tartarus inspired level, but much harder. Like how [Tartarus was once the top 1 extreme demon by far](/posts/geometry-dash-tartarus-falls-from-top-10-after-2-years/), Acheron is the new top 1 extreme demon.

*Acheron by GrenadeOfTacos and more, screenshot from [Donei GD](https://youtu.be/8NiVG9VqPlQ).*

There is not much that has to be said about this level. It is just ridiculously hard.
