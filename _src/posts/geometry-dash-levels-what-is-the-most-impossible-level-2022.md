Completing a demon level in Geometry Dash is a very difficult task. Completing an extreme demon is something only the top elite players can do. But what about impossible levels?

When RobTop Games developed everyone's favorite [rage-inducing mobile rhythm-based platformer](/posts/how-to-download-play-geometry-dash-subzero/) Geometry Dash, almost instantly players began creating impossible levels. But which level is the most impossible?

These are the 10 hardest levels ever beaten by a human, but there are other levels that can only be beaten by bots.

This is according to the [Geometry Dash Demon List](/posts/geometry-dash-demon-list-what-are-the-top-extreme-demons-2022/), the considered most accurate ranking of the hardest levels ever beaten.

# 10 Most Impossible Levels In Geometry Dash

The 10 most impossible levels in Geometry Dash as of October 2022 are:

1. Back on Track (by skubb and Corpulse, not the main level by RobTop)
2. Boeing 757
3. Smiley 792
4. Thanks Level
5. Hi Level
6. Dark Never Clear
7. Suffer
8. Heat Death
9. Schafs
10. WHOLESOMEmetathesis

Notice the abundance of joke level names. It appears Geometry Dash impossible level creators have a sense of humor.

These are the 10 hardest levels ever beaten by a bot. However, there is a level so long that it will never be beaten by a human or a bot, which is the true most impossible level in Geometry Dash.

This is according to the [Geometry Dash Silent Level List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hINX9s9FrIUsxBBCE8SKDnijq0v8krU6Qe3KoGrGBg0/edit), a ranking of impossible Geometry Dash levels.

# The True Most Impossible Level In Geometry Dash

There exists a Geometry Dash level longer than the lifetime of the universe. This level is Nessus by Skubb and others. It takes roughly [4294967296^1098*4 seconds to beat](https://youtu.be/_9rtn_Lcq7I), which is longer than the lifetime of the entire universe.

This means that nobody (or no thing) will ever beat this level, making it truly the most impossible level in Geometry Dash.

While there is no level harder than Nessus, there are many top 1 upcoming hardest levels that no human has beat yet. These include the following:
