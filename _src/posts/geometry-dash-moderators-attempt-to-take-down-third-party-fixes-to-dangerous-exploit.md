Geometry Dash moderators are supposedly trying to take down third party fixes to [Geometry Dash's latest exploit](/posts/geometry-dash-exploit-puts-all-levels-and-you-at-risk/). On May 22, 2023, a dangerous new Geometry Dash exploit was leaked. However, even before a patch was released by RobTop Games, third party mod creators made their own patches and released them for the community to stay safe from the exploit.

However, even before RobTop Games patched the exploit, there are reports that Geometry Dash moderators acting on RobTop's behalf were telling mod creators to take down their third party fixes.

# Geometry Dash Moderators' Reasoning

The apparent reason for this seems to be not wanting to spread the knowledge of the exploit. The more popular the exploit became, the more likely bad actors would discover and use it.

This reasoning has been critiqued. Many people believe that Geometry Dash players deserve to know if they are at risk. And since the exploit was already very public at that point, many believe the Geometry Dash moderators' actions to have done more harm than good.

# Aftermath

All in all, the exploit has now been patched. However, there is evidence that RobTop knew about this exploit long before it was leaked. For some reason, he failed to release a fix for it. This further proves [Stormfly's age old testament](https://youtu.be/-okuM-2e8NA) that "RobTop only acts out of necessity."
