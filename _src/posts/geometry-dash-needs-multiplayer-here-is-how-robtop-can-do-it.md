After [Geometry Dash 2.2](/categories/2.2/), Geometry Dash has pretty much every feature any creator could ask for. However, there is something that the game still needs: Multiplayer.

While Platformer mode is already begging for it, it could work in normal mode and in the editor as well. Here is our idea for a multiplayer update and how RobTop can make it happen!

But first, a Geometry Dash multiplayer update would contain three things:

1. [Normal mode multiplayer](#normal-mode-multiplayer)
2. [Platformer mode multiplayer](#platformer-mode-multiplayer)
3. [Live collab system for the level editor](live-collab-system-for-the-level-editor)
