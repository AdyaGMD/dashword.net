The famous Geometry Dash Level "OuterSpace" by Nicki1202 has [passed the former most downloaded level](https://twitter.com/today_gd/status/1573971770515808257) "Sonar" by Jerkrat in downloads. After Years of Sonar being at the top, OuterSpace has become the most downloaded level in Geometry Dash.

For the longest time, a level called "Level Easy" by Cody was the most downloaded level after becoming the first level in the first map pack. However, in update 2.0, the **Alpha Pack** was added and became the new first map pack. The first level of the Alpha pack was **Sonar.**

But in 2.1, Gauntlets were added to Geometry Dash, and the first level of the first Gauntlet was **OuterSpace.** And now, after over 5 years since 2.1 was released, it has finally surpassed Sonar in downloads, becoming the new most downloaded level in Geometry Dash.
