On September 16, Geometry Dash reached a new peak concurrent player count on Steam of over 30,000.

Over the past year, Geometry Dash received a sudden burst of popularity, with the game breaking record after record for its peak live player count. Now, the record stands at over 30,000.

Despite having [no new content added in over 6 years](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-wait-turns-6-years-old/), Geometry Dash has continued to grow. But now, with the [Geometry Dash 2.2 release date being announced](/posts/final-geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-confirmed-by-robtop/), the game is at an all time high never before seen in its history.

Once  [Geometry Dash 2.2](/categories/2.2/) releases in October, chances are the game will get even more popular. It is very likely that this record of 30,000 live players on Steam will get beaten on the day update 2.2 comes out.
