Geometry Dash by RobTop Games [has been removed from the Google Play Store](/posts/geometry-dash-moderator-says-2-2-is-right-around-the-corner/) for security concerns. [Geometry Dash has not been updated in over 6 years](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-wait-turns-6-years-old/), which means it is no longer using the latest Android safety features. To prevent any abuse, Google removed Geometry Dash from their stores.

RobTop is unable to update the game to implement the newest Android safety features because he lost the source code for Geometry Dash 2.113, the current version of the game.

RobTop only has the source code for the currently unfinished [Geometry Dash 2.2 update](/categories/2.2/). This means that the only way to update Geometry Dash is to release Geometry Dash 2.2. With this, the game will return to the Google Play Store once RobTop releases Geometry Dash 2.2.

RobTop said he could recreate Geometry Dash 2.113 and update the game to return it to the Google Play Store, but this would take just as long as it would take to release update 2.2.

That being said, there is no reason RobTop will work any harder on releasing Geometry Dash 2.2 because of this. A similar situation happened when [Geometry Dash broke on Apple devices running iOS 15](/posts/geometry-dash-how-to-fix-ios-crash-bug/). Despite Geometry Dash being unplayable on the latest software version, RobTop failed to do anything.

That being said, Geometry Dash 2.2 is very close. With the [Geometry Dash 2.2 sneak peek 3](/posts/final-geometry-dash-2-2-sneak-peek-released-by-robtop-games/) coming out and the [final Geometry Dash 2.2 release date confirmed](/posts/robtop-confirms-third-and-final-geometry-dash-2-2-release-date/), update 2.2 is likely only months, maybe only weeks, away.
