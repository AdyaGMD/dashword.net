As of 4:48 AM EDT, the Geometry Dash servers are currently down. This is so that they can migrate to stronger servers before [update 2.2](/categories/).

While RobTop Games originally said the server migration should take 6 hours, he has now said it could take upwards of 10 hours.

With this, you can expect the Geometry Dash servers to be back up by 4:00 PM EDT.

RobTop has confirmed that Geometry Dash 2.2 will not be releasing today or tomorrow because of the server downtime. However, we can still expect [update 2.2 this month](/posts/final-geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-confirmed-by-robtop/), but there is a small chance that [update 2.2 will be delayed until November](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-might-get-delayed-to-after-october/).
