Grief by Icedcave and more is a remake of the 2015 Geometry Dash extreme demon Slaughterhouse. In specific, it focuses on the 2015 version of the once top 1 hardest level on the [Demon List](/posts/geometry-dash-demon-list-where-to-find-the-hardest-demons/). It is [set to be verified by Doggie](/posts/geometry-dash-top-10-extreme-demon-deimos-verified-by-doggie/).

At one point, [Slaughterhouse reigned as the top 1 hardest level in Geometry Dash for over a year](/posts/geometry-dash-slaughterhouse-top-1/). While we now know this was largely due to [SpaceUK lying and hacking to keep the level on the top](/posts/top-1-geometry-dash-player-spaceuk-exposed-for-hacking-achievements/), this is still an incredible feat.

The expected placement of Grief on the Pointercrate Demon List is not yet known, but many speculate that [it will be top 1 in its current state](/posts/geometry-dash-golden-gates-decoration-preview-top-1-extreme-demon/). We will have to see where it places after Doggie verifies it.

This is Icedcave's next big project, so there will certainly be a lot of hype around this level.
