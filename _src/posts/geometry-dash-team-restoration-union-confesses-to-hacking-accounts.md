The Geometry Dash team "Restoration Union," known for finding a copy of the [infamous lost level Element 111 Rg](/posts/geometry-dash-element-111-rg-found-but-theres-a-catch/) a few days ago, has confessed to using immoral methods to obtain accounts.

In general, [they confessed to accessing accounts without permission from the account owners](https://twitter.com/restoration_uni/status/1580215354290106368), but [there are cases of team members hacking into accounts](https://twitter.com/restoration_uni/status/1580215559076970502).

This is [some of what they had to say](https://twitter.com/restoration_uni/status/1580215354290106368):

> To elaborate on what has been spreading around on Twitter over the past few days, we have been accessing a couple of old accounts without the permission of their respected owners for the sole purpose of preserving Geometry Dash history.

They also went on to [assure us that they did not use any exploits](https://twitter.com/restoration_uni/status/1580215393045860353) and that our accounts are safe.

So the question remains: should we allow the accessing of old accounts for The purpose of Geometry Dash history? This is a case of ethics, and everyone's answer will vary.

But as a thought experiment, what if there is a full copy of Element 111 Rg on one of these old accounts? How about a copy of Ice Carbon Titan X? Is accessing these old accounts without permission justified?

We'd love to hear what you have to say [in our Discord server](https://discord.gg/SqZuGCpHMm)!
