After months of pressure from Geometry Dash players, RobTop has finally rated Tidal Wave. [After the top 1 extreme demon was verified by Zoink in September 2023](/posts/new-top-1-geometry-dash-demon-tidal-wave-verified-by-zoink-in-50000-attempts/), it remained unrated, meaning it could not officially claim the top 1 spot on the [Geometry Dash Demon List](/posts/geometry-dash-demon-list-where-to-find-the-hardest-demons/).

[Tidal Wave recieved lots of criticism](/posts/geometry-dash-top-1-extreme-demon-tidal-wave-critiqued-as-controversial-but-original/) from players and the Moderator team for its debatably ugly decoration. After the Moderator team failed to vote in favor of rating the level, the decision to rate the level was left to RobTop, the developer of Geometry Dash.

After months of pressure from players, [RobTop said that he didn't want to rate the level](/posts/robtop-confirms-tidal-wave-will-not-be-rated/) due to it having unfun gameplay, not representing Geometry Dash very well, and being controversial.

However, shortly after this statement, RobTop has rated Tidal Wave.

Tidal Wave has now placed at #1 on the Geometry Dash Demon List, making it the new [hardest level ever made in Geometry Dash](/posts/geometry-dash-levels-what-is-the-hardest-level-ever-made/).
