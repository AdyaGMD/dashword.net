The once impossible Geometry Dash level Natural Disaster was verified by Helix on October 30, 2022. It is estimated to place in the top 10 on the Demon list.

You can [watch Helix's completion video](https://youtu.be/Soc-JeRJtqM) to see the verification as well as his reaction.

The Demon List team has yet to place this level due to it only being verified very recently. However, the verifier himself thinks [it is around top 10 difficulty](/posts/geometry-dash-mayhem-places-top-10-in-demonlist/).

Natural Disaster is not the only upcoming extreme demon gathering attention, however. Here are some more Demon List news:
