After over two years since its announcement, Geometry Dash player Bgram has verified Limbo, the hardest memory demon ever made.

After the [full showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBbuH_SPbs) on November 30, 2021, BGram started verifying the level. After over a year, [he has verified it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXYMbaMVOZg) on November 25, 2022.

In Mindcap's [verification announcement video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtKV9uSa5jQ), he states that Limbo should place in the top 5 hardest levels ever made.

Lï»¿imbo is a level highly regarded as [the most anticipated level in Geometry Dash](/posts/limbo-analysis/). Seeing it released after all these years is truly astonishing.
