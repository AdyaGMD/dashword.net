After freeing the monster prisoner in Geometry Dash, here's what happens and what you can do next.

The imprisoned monster, also known as the [Demon Guardian](/posts/geometry-dash-how-to-unlock-the-basement-and-demon-guardian/), is an NPC in Geometry Dash that you can free by collecting 3 keys hidden around the game.

# What Happens When You Free The Monster?

After collecting these 3 keys, the monster tells you he will **destroy Geometry Dash** and he disappears.

You will also get a chest filled with icons, the key to the Demon Gauntlet, and other rewards.

# What To Do After Freeing The Monster

After you free the monster, you will get access to the Demon Gauntlet. You can complete that gauntlet to get a really cool looking spider icon.

After that, you will need to wait for the next update, **Geometry Dash 2.2**, to continue.

[Once Geometry Dash 2.2 comes out](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-confirmed-2023/), the monster will stay true to what he said and return. In the meantime, however, you should prepare yourself by collecting stars, [diamonds](/posts/geometry-dash-how-to-get-diamonds-easy/), [orbs](/posts/geometry-dash-how-to-get-mana-orbs-easy/), and [demon keys](/posts/geometry-dash-how-to-get-demon-keys-easy/).

It is likely that these items will prove useful once Geometry Dash 2.2 is released.

# How To Free The Monster

To free the monster, you will need to unlock and complete the basement quest. Fortunately, [we wrote an entire, in-depth guide](/posts/geometry-dash-all-vaults-and-secrets-2022/#the-basement) to help you!
