After freeing the monster prisoner in Geometry Dash, here's what happens and what you can do next.

The imprisoned monster, also known as the [Demon Guardian](/posts/geometry-dash-how-to-unlock-the-basement-and-demon-guardian/), is an NPC in Geometry Dash that you can free by collecting 3 keys hidden around the game.

After collecting these 3 keys, the monster tells you he will **destroy Geometry Dash** and he disappears, leaving you a chest filled with loot.
