On October 2, 2023, Geometry Dash YouTuber Doggie was hacked and had his YouTube channel stolen shortly after starting a live stream. The hacker demanded that Doggie rebeat the infamous top 1 extreme demon [Slaughterhouse](/posts/geometry-dash-slaughterhouse-top-1/) to get his channel back.

Doggie, still being live but having no access to his account, faked rebeating Slaughterhouse. Believing he really did beat Slaughterhouse, the hacker gave Doggie a fake password, showing that he was lying the whole time.

Shortly after, the hacker finally managed to end Doggie's stream.

From there on out, the hacker renamed Doggie's channel and started a new live stream to promote a crypto scam.

During all this, the Geometry Dash community got [#FreeDoggie](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FreeDoggie&src=typed_query&f=top) trending on Twitter (now X).
