On October 2, 2023, Geometry Dash YouTuber Doggie was hacked and had his YouTube channel stolen shortly after starting a live stream. The hacker demanded that Doggie rebeat the infamous top 1 extreme demon [Slaughterhouse](/posts/geometry-dash-slaughterhouse-top-1/) to get his channel back.

Doggie, still being live but having no access to his account, faked rebeating Slaughterhouse. Believing he really did beat it, the hacker gave Doggie a fake password, showing that he was lying the whole time.

Shortly after, the hacker finally managed to end Doggie's stream.

From there on out, the hacker rebranded Doggie's channel to a fake company and started a new live stream to promote a crypto scam, but not after a [series of embarrassing community posts](https://twitter.com/sdslayer100/status/1709167146725736800) attempting to lie about the situation, but just making the hacker look like a child instead.

*"Ripple US" is what Doggie's channel was renamed to. Do not engage with it until it has been restored. Assume everything it posts is a scam.*

During all this, the Geometry Dash community got [#FreeDoggie](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FreeDoggie&src=typed_query&f=top) trending on Twitter (now X).

YouTube has supposedly reached out to Doggie which means his channel should be restored shortly.

# This method of hacking is not new

This method of stealing channels is not new. [Linus Tech Tips](https://youtu.be/yGXaAWbzl5A?si=3T9YF2Da_xLmKJlx) got hacked a while back using a method near identical to this one, showing that anyone can fall for this trick.

[Danzmen](https://www.youtube.com/@danzmen9965/featured), another Geometry Dash YouTuber, also got hacked via a similar method several years ago.

Needless to say, seeing how even big channels are being affected by this, [YouTube should consider doing more](https://twitter.com/MoldyMacaroniX/status/1709171944749228476).

# Doggie Channel Recovery

On October 4, 2:42 AM EDT, Doggie [shared](https://twitter.com/DasherDoggie/status/1709458856361767120) that he regained access to his Google account. While his YouTube channel is currently offline, it will get reinstated soon and everything will be back to normal.
