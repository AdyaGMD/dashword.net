Geometry Dash YouTubers Vortrox, Tride, Moldy, Sdslayer, and MatMart have met up at VidCon Anaheim this year.

In addition, content creators Rykiion and Lopsided Chicken also joined them, as reported by [Vortrox](http://youtube.com/post/UgkxWkmtkMOY-B_X0WhFKG9VYH36JGebRYZ1?si=1G_ECJBNnE7U6_H3).

After hanging out at the VidCon convention, Vortrox, Tride, Moldy, and Sdslayer streamed together on the latter's YouTube channel.

By now, the YouTubers are working on spending a few more days together before flying back to their respective home countries.
