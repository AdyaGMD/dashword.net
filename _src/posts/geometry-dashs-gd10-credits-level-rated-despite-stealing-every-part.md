Despite RobTop unrating Geometry Dash levels with stolen assets in the past, "GD10" by Floppy was rated by RobTop. In this level, every part is stolen from another level.

The Geometry Dash commuity is divided by this decision. Some players believe the level deserves a rating due to it being in the credits of the [Geometry Dash 10 Year Anniversary video](/posts/will-geometry-dash-2-2-come-out-on-the-games-10-year-anniversary/). Others believe that is not a valid excuse to rate the level while unrating levels that use far less stolen assets.

I share a less black-and-white view.

# My opinion

In my opinion, [GD10](https://gdbrowser.com/93618912) by Floppy, and similar "montage levels" like [Ultimate Demon Mix](https://gdbrowser.com/10229235) and [Obscurum](https://gdbrowser.com/16156623), shouldn't necessarily be ineligible for a rate. After all, RobTop chose to rate them.

Instead, I believe that all levels should follow the same rules. If GD10 is eligible for a rate, then so should levels like [Natural Disaster that feature much less stolen assets](/posts/geometry-dash-extreme-demon-natural-disaster-unrated-following-accusations/).

Many will say that the situation is different for GD10, and that it deserves a rate because of its place in the official GD10 video. But I've [yet to hear](https://twitter.com/ashes2207/status/1693737941569605977) a good excuse for why that makes this level worthy of special privileges.

Some also say that since GD10 doesn't try to pass the parts off as their own, that makes it worthy of a rating whereas Natural Disaster unworthy due to its stolen assets being much more discrete. But this is an unfair comparison as GD10 features entire parts that are very well known whereas Natural Disaster only steals a couple assets at most.
