Despite saying that Geometry Dash 2.2 was "[about to be completely finished for release](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-is-finished-release-scheduled-for-early-december/)," RobTop Games has shown no signs that the update has even been submitted to the App Store, Google Play Store, or Steam.

While Viprin [seems to think this silence from RobTop is a deliberate decision to keep the game's servers stable for when update 2.2 releases](/posts/robtop-will-release-geometry-dash-2-2-with-no-warning/), he stopped short of giving a complete confirmation despite saying he actually knows what is going on.
