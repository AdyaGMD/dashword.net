Despite saying that Geometry Dash 2.2 was "[about to be completely finished for release](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-is-finished-release-scheduled-for-early-december/)," RobTop Games has shown no signs that the update has even been submitted to the App Store, Google Play Store, or Steam for review.

While Viprin [seems to think this silence from RobTop is a deliberate decision to keep the game's servers stable for when update 2.2 releases](/posts/robtop-will-release-geometry-dash-2-2-with-no-warning/), he stopped short of giving a complete confirmation despite saying he actually knows what is going on.

We would hope that RobTop has already submitted [Geometry Dash 2.2](/categories/2.2) to stores, but for all we know, the update is not even finished yet. RobTop was careful to say that update 2.2 was "about to be completely finished" instead of saying it was already finished.

Right now, we believe there are two possibilities for what is currently going on.

# Best case scenario

In the best case scenario, RobTop has already submitted update 2.2 to stores and is waiting for it to be accepted.

The reason he is staying silent is because he doesn't want to give an exact release date as that might lead to an influx of players overwhelming the game's servers.

# Worst case scenario

In the worst case scenario, RobTop has not even finished update 2.2 yet and has yet to submit it to stores for review.

With this, the reason he is staying silent could be because he has nothing new to say and is waiting to finish the update before giving another statement.

Both of these scenarios are possible, but given what Viprin shared, we believe the best case scenario is most likely to be the case. With that, we can expect Geometry Dash 2.2 to release any day now.

However, if RobTop has yet to submit Geometry Dash 2.2 to stores for review, we could be waiting a lot longer.

Only time will tell what is going on.
