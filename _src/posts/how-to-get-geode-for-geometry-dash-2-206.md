# How to get Geode for Geometry Dash 2.206

You can download Geode for your Windows, Mac, or Android device from the [official Geode GitHub page](https://github.com/geode-sdk/geode).

1. Download Geode for your device [from its GitHub release page](https://github.com/geode-sdk/geode/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha.1).
2. Run the installer you just downloaded.
3. Delete any `.dll` files from your game files if the installer tells you too. This is because Geode does not support other mod loaders.
