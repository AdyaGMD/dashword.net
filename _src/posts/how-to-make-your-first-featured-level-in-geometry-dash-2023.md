If you've ever tried to make a featured level in Geometry Dash, you might be confused as to why your levels aren't getting noticed. Fortunately, there is a science to getting your levels featured in Geometry Dash that we hope to share with you here.

In Geometry Dash, there are three ratings a level can get: a regular star rating, a featured rating, and an epic rating. A regular star rating rewards one creator point, a featured rating rewards two, and an epic rating rewards three.

If a level is worthy of a rating, what it gets is hand-picked by the developer, [RobTop Games](/posts/robtop-confirms-geometry-dash-2-3-will-come-out-6-months-from-when-he-starts/). Fortunately, a featured rating is by far the most common rating levels seen by RobTop obtain.

This guide will go over [how to make a feature worthy level](/posts/5-tips-to-get-your-first-featured-level-in-geometry-dash/) and get it noticed by RobTop.

# Making Feature Worthy Gameplay

The biggest factor that makes a level feature worthy over just star rate worthy is **good gameplay**. Gameplay is how the level plays without decoration.

Having fun gameplay is essential to a level being well received. If people don't enjoy playing your level, [then it is less likely to be noticed by RobTop](/posts/geometry-dash-levels-how-to-make-a-featured-level-2022/).

There are two ways to go about making gameplay for your level: you can make the entire gameplay before decorating it, or you can build gameplay and decorate at the same time.

We recommend building gameplay in "chunks." After building a short chunk of gameplay, decorate it, and repeat.
