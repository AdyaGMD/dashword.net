# How To Stop Geometry Dash From Updating

1. Go to your Steam library, right click Geometry Dash, and press **Properties**
2. Press **Updates**
3. Set **Automatic Updates** to **Only update this game when I launch it**
4. Press **Installed Files**
5. Press **Browse**
6. Double click the **Geometry Dash.exe** file to play the game without updating it.

You only need to go through steps 1-3 once and you can set a shortcut for **GeometryDash.exe** to make finding it easier.

Note that this only works if you haven't already updated Geometry Dash. It is a good idea to disable auto updates on games like Geometry Dash and any other games you don't want to update.
