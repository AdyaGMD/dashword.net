I'm going to be the first to say it: I am a Geometry Dash YouTuber. Whether or not you think that makes me knowledgeable or bias is up to you. All I ask is that you hear me out.

In the early days, Geometry Dash YouTube consisted predominantly of EveryPlay replays. Seeing a big YouTuber actually play the game with commentary was a luxury and seeing someone commentate on the game ws impossible.
