I'm going to be the first to say it: I am a Geometry Dash YouTuber. Whether or not you think that makes me knowledgeable or bias is up to you. All I ask is that you hear me out.

In the early days, Geometry Dash YouTube consisted of EveryPlay replays. Seeing a big YouTuber actually play the game with live reactions was a luxury and seeing someone give detailed commentary on the game was impossible.

But as time went on, some dedicated Geometry Dash players started uploading to their YouTube channels. It started with replays of their completions but soon enough some would begin to go beyond that.

As time went on, content would get bigger. YouTubers like EVW focused his content solely on Geometry Dash while players like Sea1997 introduced detailed commentary to the game.

But what stayed constant was that those who made videos on the game would not make a career out of it. While popular, the game did not have a big enough viewerbase on YouTube. Those who wanted to make real money would pursue traditional careers or at the very least had a part time job.

With this, those making content mostly did it out of passion. While getting some ad revenue on the side was nice, making a living off of Geometry Dash was never going to happen.
