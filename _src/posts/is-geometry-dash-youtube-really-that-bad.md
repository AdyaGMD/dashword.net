I'm going to be the first to say it: I am a Geometry Dash YouTuber. Whether or not you think that makes me knowledgeable or bias is up to you. All I ask is that you hear me out.

In the early days, Geometry Dash YouTube consisted of EveryPlay replays. Seeing a big YouTuber actually play the game with live reactions was a luxury and seeing someone give detailed commentary on the game was impossible.

But as time went on, some dedicated Geometry Dash players started uploading to their YouTube channels. It started with replays of their completions but soon enough some would begin to go beyond that.

As time went on, content would get bigger. YouTubers like EVW focused his content solely on Geometry Dash while players like Sea1997 introduced detailed commentary to the game.

But what stayed constant was that those who made videos on the game would not make a career out of it. While popular, the game did not have a big enough viewerbase on YouTube. Those who wanted to make real money would pursue traditional careers or at the very least had a part time job.

With this, those making content mostly did it out of passion. While getting some ad revenue on the side was nice, making a living off of Geometry Dash was never going to happen.

But for the first time ever: that is changing.

With the community constantly reaching new peak player peaks and being the most alive it'a ever been, a Geometry Dsh YouTube revolution went underway. Many Geometry Dash channels, of all different kinds, popped up in 2021 and blew up in 2022.

With this, YouTubers began to notice that this passive revenue started to become a lot. It started to become enough to pay for rent and food. Then it started to become enough to buy luxuries. Perhaps, for the first time ever, it was possible to make a sizeable income off of Geometry Dsh YouTube.

Making a living off of YouTube was nothing new. But making a living off of Geometry Dash YouTube was unheard of.

With the combination of countless new YouTubers joining the scene and the rising potential ad revenue possible, Geometry Dash YouTube started to become competitive. Wherever money is to be made, there will always be competition.
