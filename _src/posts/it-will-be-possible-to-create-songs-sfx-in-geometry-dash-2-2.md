RobTop Games recently released a video of him making a song with [sound effects from Geometry Dash 2.2](/posts/final-geometry-dash-2-2-sneak-peek-released-by-robtop-games/).

This will allow creators to make their own songs in Geometry Dash. It won't have as many customization options as traditional music creation software, but the fact that it's possible is very interesting.

Geometry Dash 2.2 is suspected to [release before August 31 of this year](/posts/robtop-confirms-third-and-final-geometry-dash-2-2-release-date/), but that may be pushed back seeing as RobTop has shown little signs of being able to finish the update by then.
