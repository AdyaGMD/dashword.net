Geometry Dash player JohaNoha shows what will be possible in 2.2 by building a level in the [2.2 private server](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-private-server-download-install/).

Many are saying that [it doesn't even look like it was made in Geometry Dash](https://youtu.be/Ogv-MJ4cKlA). One viewer noted:

> doesnt even look like a level, it looks like an edit. absolutely insane!

# Community Backlash

Upon being shared by [GD Today](https://twitter.com/today_gd/status/1545084552686731264), the Geometry Dash community responded with criticism.

Popular YouTuber [Tride](https://twitter.com/TriDeapthBear/status/1545132564956041221) noted the following:

> Keen for more blind transitions than there already are

While obviously a joke, it expresses a fear the community has.

Blind transitions are when the creator hides what is coming up next in a level and only shows you when it is too late for you to react, causing you to crash.

This 2.2 level by JohaNoha appears to have many blind transitions, even more than we are used to today.
