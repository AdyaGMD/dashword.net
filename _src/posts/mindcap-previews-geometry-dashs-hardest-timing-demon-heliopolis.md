Mindcap, [the creator of Limbo](/posts/geometry-dash-top-5-extreme-demon-limbo-verified-by-bgram/), has previewed the upcoming hardest timing extreme demon in Geometry Dash, Heliopolis.

He describes this as a sunless city, which the [current asthetic](https://youtu.be/xAHrT0qf2rI) absolutely nails.

Heliopolis feels like a  corrupted, toxic city that hasnâ€™t seen a clear beam of sunlight in years.
