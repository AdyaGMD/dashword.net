On October 1st, 2023, RobTop released a new Geometry Dash 2.2 beta. Like the [previous](/posts/closed-geometry-dash-2-2-beta-released-on-steam/) [two](/posts/robtop-releases-new-geometry-dash-2-2-beta/), this one isn't available to the public, but what sets this one apart is that it was released on the first day of October, which is also the [release month for Geometry Dash 2.2](/posts/final-geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-confirmed-by-robtop/).

While RobTop did say there was a chance [Geometry Dash 2.2 gets delayed even further](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-might-get-delayed-to-after-october/), the general belief is that [update 2.2](/categories/2.2/) will release in October.

Also like the previous two closed beta releases, is unknown as to whether or not RobTop Games will give anyone access to this beta.
