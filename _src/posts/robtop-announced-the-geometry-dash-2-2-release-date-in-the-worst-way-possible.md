I've always been one to defend RobTop but it is really hard to do that when we've been waiting [nearly 7 years for Geometry Dash 2.2](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-wait-turns-6-years-old/). I get game development has its hurdles but I can't help but think RobTop made a good amount of missteps along the way.

But without a doubt the biggest misstep RobTop has made is [missing the Geometry Dash 2.2 release date](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-delayed-until-november-2023/).

With this single mistake, RobTop singlehandedly destroyed what little trustworthiness he had left. It doesn't matter that RobTop says it is being delayed to November. Its just impossible to trust him.

I'm honestly surprised that [most people are seemingly okay with this](https://twitter.com/sdslayer100/status/1715811132441829526). And don't get me wrong, I'm fine waiting an extra month for the update. But that doesn't change the fact that trusting RobTop is no longer possible. The update could get delayed to 2024 at this point and I genuinely wouldn't be surprised.

So let us take a look and see what went wrong. Let's see what led to this outcome and how RobTop announced the [Geometry Dash 2.2 release date](/posts/final-geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-confirmed-by-robtop/) in the worst way possible.

# First things first: RobTop is *not* lazy

I see a lot of people sending hate towards RobTop due to 2.2 getting delayed. And the first thing I can say before anything is that **hate is never justified**. You have the right to critique RobTop and be disappointed, but hate won't make anything better.

One "argument" (if you can even call it that) I keep seeing, however, is that *RobTop is lazy*.

But that couldn't be further from the truth.

2.2 getting delayed was not a result of laziness. RobTop has [been working nonstop on update 2.2](/categories/2.2/), especially since [GD10](/posts/will-geometry-dash-2-2-come-out-on-the-games-10-year-anniversary/).

RobTop hasn't always made the best decisions, but blaming this outcome on laziness is entirely unfounded.

There are many things you can criticize RobTop for. But laziness is not one of them.

# Exhibit A: We were given a release *month?*

From the start, [I had my suspicions that 2.2 was going to get delayed until November](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-might-get-delayed-to-after-october/). And it all started with a release *month*.

I'd imagine if RobTop was confident, he would give us a release day instead of a release month. Without a precise release date, 2.2's release felt like a far off estimate instead of a set-in-stone fact.

I was surprised that RobTop wouldn't just give a release date like October 31st (or November 1st if he didn't want to release it on Halloween). I don't think there is any harm in finishing the update a few weeks early and giving us an actual release date to look forward to instead of [convincing the community that the update would just be dropped with no warning](https://twitter.com/MoldyMacaroniX/status/1703263177440436575).

Speaking of this, the lack of communication between RobTop and the community throughout this ordeal was very disappointing. All we were given were a few ominous Discord messages. We were only properly warned of the update being delayed only a little over a week before the end of October.

Given that RobTop did not feel confident enough to give a specific day in *one of the most hyped up Geometry Dash videos ever made,* perhaps a far off estimate is all this "release date" ever was.
