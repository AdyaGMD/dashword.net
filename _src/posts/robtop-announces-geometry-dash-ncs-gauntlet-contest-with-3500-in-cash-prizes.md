All of the top 10 will get an Epic, Legendary, or Mythic rating, and will have a spot in one of two NCS Gauntlets. The levels in each of these will be placed and played in order of difficulty, not by their placement from 1st to 10th.

# NCS Gauntlet Contest Rules

- The main song must be from the NCS Library. It must take up at least 80% of the level's duration when playing from start to finish. This means that you can choose to mix in non-NCS music if you wish, but only for up to 20%. Note that you can use several NCS songs to fill up the 80% requirement, not just a single one.
- Game Type: Classic. Platformer levels are not allowed in this contest.
- Length: Long or XL. In other words, it must be 1 minute or longer in duration.
- Objects: Max 120K. In special cases, we may allow up to 150K objects if the level is optimized very well with a good Low Detail Mode. However, staying below 120K is recommended.
- Difficulty: Easy 2 Stars to Easy Demon 10 Stars. If your level is right on the border towards Medium Demon, it may still qualify.
