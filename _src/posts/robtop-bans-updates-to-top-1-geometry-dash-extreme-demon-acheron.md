Acheron, the current top 1 extreme demon in Geometry Dash, is a level notorious for being the hardest level ever made. But there is something going on.

Despite this, there was a part in the level where you could use an easier click pattern to pass.

While this did not greatly change the difficulty, the level uploader Ryamu released an update that makes a message saying "not cool man" follow the player if they perform this method of playing the level.

Days later, the Geometry Dash developer RobTop reverted the level to its original form.

In protest, the level's verifier Zoink buffed the level and verified the "buffdate" despite knowing that the official level could never be updated.

Buffdates are not uncommon. Famous levels like Digital Descent have received buffdates with no reaction from RobTop.

RobTop needs to be consistant. Why should levels like Digital Descent be allowed updates while levels like Acheron not? What makes this even worse is that Digital Descent is uploaded by Viprin, a player more or less "friends" with RobTop.

Ultimately, what do you think? Does Acheron deserve the right to recieve updates, or should it forever be locked in its original form?
