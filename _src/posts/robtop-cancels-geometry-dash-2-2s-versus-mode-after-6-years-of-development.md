After [6 years of Geometry Dash 2.2 development](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-wait-turns-6-years-old/), the game's developer RobTop has canceled Versus Mode, a feature that would allow you to race levels with friends.

This means Versus Mode will not be released with update 2.2, [which itself is expected to release later this year](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-confirmed-2023/).

RobTop said that Versus Mode will likely be delayed so he can fix some stuff.

This means that instead of coming out in [Geometry Dash 2.2](/categories/2.2/), Versus Mode will be released in 2.21 after [Geometry Dash 2.2 is released](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-news-everything-we-know-about-when-2-2-will-come-out/).

2.21 will be a small patch update similar to update 2.11.

While disappointing, this means [Geometry Dash 2.2 will come out faster](/posts/why-is-2-2-taking-so-long/).
