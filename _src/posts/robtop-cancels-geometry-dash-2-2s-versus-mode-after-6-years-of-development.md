After [6 years of Geometry Dash 2.2 development](posts/geometry-dash-2-2-wait-turns-6-years-old/), the game's developer RobTop has canceled Versus Mode, a [gameplay mode](/posts/robtop-has-geometry-dash-2-3-game-mode-planned/) that would allow you to race levels with friends.

This means Versus Mode will not be released with update 2.2, [which is expected to release later this year](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-confirmed-2023/).
