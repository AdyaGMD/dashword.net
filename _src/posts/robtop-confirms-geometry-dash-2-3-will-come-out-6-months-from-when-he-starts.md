RobTop confirmed in the [Geometry Dash Discord server](/posts/geometry-dash-discord-server-how-to-join-request-levels/) that update 2.3 is planned to come out 6 months from when he starts working on it.

![RobTop says 2.3 will come out 6 months from when he starts](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/392087938239954950/1069802705138241556/image.png)

However, the catch is that RobTop said he will first work on a bugfix update for Geometry Dash 2.2 before working on 2.3. **This means that 2.3 will not come out 6 months after 2.2.**

Despite this, [the fact that RobTop promises to release 2.3 relatively soon is nice](/posts/robtop-says-he-will-never-make-an-update-as-big-as-2-2-ever-again/) considering that [we've been waiting over 6 years for Geometry Dash 2.2 to come out](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-wait-turns-6-years-old/).

So, with the [Geometry Dash 2.2 release date confirmed](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-confirmed-2023/), we think update 2.3 will come out before the end of 2024.

Assuming it takes RobTop half a year to bugfix update 2.2 after its release, we can reasonably expect update 2.3 in the summer of 2024.

Expecting it to take half a year to bugfix 2.2 is not totally unheard of when we consider the state of the [Geometry Dash 2.2 private server](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-private-server-download-install/). Regardless, 2.3 should be released no later than December 2024 assuming RobTop sticks to his word this time around.
