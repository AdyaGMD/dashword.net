RobTop confirmed in the [Geometry Dash Discord server](/posts/geometry-dash-discord-server-how-to-join-request-levels/) that update 2.3 is planned to come out 6 months from when he starts working on it.

![RobTop says 2.3 will come out 6 months from when he starts](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/392087938239954950/1069802705138241556/image.png)

However, the catch is that RobTop said he will first work on a bugfix update for Geometry Dash 2.2 before working on 2.3. **This means that 2.3 will not come out 6 months after 2.2.**

Despite this, the fact that RobTop promises to release 2.3 relatively soon is nice considering that we've been waiting over 6 years for Geometry Dash 2.2 to come out.
