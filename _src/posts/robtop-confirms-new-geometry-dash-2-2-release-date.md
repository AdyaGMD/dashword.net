RobTop has once again confirmed a new Geometry Dash 2.2 release date. After failing to meet [his previous release date](/posts/2-2-release-date-confirmed/), he once again confirmed in the [Geometry Dash Discord](/posts/geometry-dash-discord-server-how-to-join-request-levels/) that 2.2 will release in early to mid 2023.

{% alert %}
RobTop has since confirmed a final Geometry Dash 2.2 release date of October 2023. [Read more with this link](/posts/final-geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-confirmed-by-robtop/).
{% endalert %}

This means that [Geometry Dash 2.2](/categories/2.2/) should release between January and June, 2023.

Like I said last year, this [perfectly aligns with my new prediction](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date/) for Geometry Dash 2.2's release date.

RobTop also said the reason he failed to meet his previous release date of 2022 was because of maintaining the free games: [Geometry Dash Lite, Meltdown, SubZero, and World](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-editor-unlocked-how-to-get-the-2-2-level-editor-2022/).

Fortunately, all free games have been updated since 2022. With this, we can expect RobTop to stick to his word and release Geometry Dash 2.2 early this year.

Geometry Dash 2.2 is very close. What is the first you'll do once the update is released?
