title: RobTop Confirms Upcoming "Custom Art System" For Geometry Dash
desc: On Twitter, I asked RobTop Games whether or not he could release vector
  versions of Geometry Dash assets for YouTubers to use in their videos. While
  he will not be releasing such assets yet, he confirmed the existence of what
  he calls a "custom art system" for Geometry Dash, likely for update 2.3 or
  2.4.

On Twitter, I asked RobTop Games whether or not he could release vector versions of Geometry Dash assets for YouTubers to use in their videos. While he will not be releasing such assets yet, he confirmed the existence of what he calls a "custom art system" for Geometry Dash, [likely for update 2.3 or 2.4](/posts/robtop-confirms-geometry-dash-2-3-will-come-out-6-months-from-when-he-starts/).

While RobTop has expressed some ideas for this feature before, this is the first time he has confirmed it to be in a future Geometry Dash update. This will likely not be available in [Geometry Dash 2.2](/categories/2.2/), but in update 2.3 or 2.4.

RobTop [said the following](https://twitter.com/RobTopGames/status/1661817367603683330):

> Maybe when we add the custom art system in a later update

As for what exactly this "custom art system" implies, we have limited knowledge of. Supposedly, this new system will allow creators to make their own custom art for their levels without having to use thousands of objects.

This would make custom art a lot easier to create and would reduce lag by optimizing levels a lot.
