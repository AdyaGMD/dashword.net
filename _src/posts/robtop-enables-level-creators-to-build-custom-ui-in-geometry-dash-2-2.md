RobTop recently leaked a new Geometry Dash 2.2 UI system that allows level creators to build their own custom user interface for their levels. This GUI editor has been theorized to exist before but this is the first official preview we've got.

* RobTop revealed a new UI editor feature for Geometry Dash 2.2
* This feature allows creators to lock objects to the edge of the screen
* The objects will be locked to the edge of the screen even if the camera size or rotation is changed
* RobTop also previewed new textures for the 2.2 platformer controls

This [new 2.2 system](/posts/robtop-previewed-geometry-dash-2-2-keyframe-system/) allows creators to stick objects to the edge of the screen, for example, in the top right corner. This is important, as different users play on different aspect ratios.

In other news, RobTop revealed the new texture for the [Geometry Dash 2.2 platformer controls](/posts/robtop-says-geometry-dash-2-2-platformer-mode-will-start-to-really-shine-in-2-3/). He chose to make them transparent so they no longer obstruct the gameplay.

The thin black outlines around the buttons are to show the [touch radius for mobile devices](/posts/will-geometry-dash-2-2-be-available-on-mobile/) and will be hidden in the final 2.2 release.
