RobTop has confirmed that he has the Geometry Dash 2.3 game mode planned. At this time, however, he remains secret about it.

On the [Geometry Dash Discord](/posts/geometry-dash-discord-server-how-to-join-request-levels/) server, [RobTop confirmed](https://twitter.com/today_gd/status/1584696233255657472) that he has the Geometry Dash 2.3 game mode already planned.

Fortunately, he assures us that he has not yet started it. This is good because it means Geometry Dash 2.2 will come out faster.
