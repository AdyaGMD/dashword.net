On September 21, RobTop Games released a new Geometry Dash 2.2 beta [only 39 days after releasing the first one](/posts/closed-geometry-dash-2-2-beta-released-on-steam/).

Like the first one, this beta is closed and not available to the public.

Also like the first one, this beta is protected by a password. In order to access it, you need to input the correct password. As of now, the password is unknown.

It is unknown as to whether or not RobTop Games will give anyone access to this beta.
