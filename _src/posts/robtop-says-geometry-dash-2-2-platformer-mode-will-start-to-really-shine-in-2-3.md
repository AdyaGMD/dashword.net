Geometry Dash developer RobTop said the 2.2 platformer mode will "start to really shine" in updates 2.3 and 2.4. However, he still plans to have it available in 2.2.

Specifically, RobTop said this about the Geometry Dash 2.2 platformer mode:

>﻿ I think platformer mode will start to really shine in 2.3/2.4

RobTop also said that he wants to add a sound effect trigger to platformer mode to make it feel complete, specifically in 2.3:

>﻿ 2.3 should have sound triggers yes

R﻿obTop insists that the Geometry Dash 2.2 platformer mode needs sound effects:

>﻿ Sound effects are needed to make platformer good but one step at a time

What do you think? Does Geometry Dash 2.2 platformer mode really need sound effects? If so, is 2.3 a reasonable update for it?
