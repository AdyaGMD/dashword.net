RobTop said in the [Geometry Dash Discord server](/posts/geometry-dash-discord-server-how-to-join-request-levels/) that he will never make an update as big as Geometry Dash 2.2 ever again.

Having 2.1 recently turn 6 years old, I think everyone can agree that we will never want to wait so long for an update ever again. And RobTop is aware of this.

But regardlessâ€”Geometry Dash 2.2 must be nearly complete, right? Well, the legendary update might come out sooner than you think, as RobTop recently [confirmed a new Geometry Dash 2.2 release date](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-confirmed-2023/).

What are you most looking forward to in Geometry Dash 2.2?
