RobTop has recently updated the [Geometry Dash 2.2 beta](/posts/closed-geometry-dash-2-2-beta-released-on-steam/) twice within the span of an hour. This is confusing as [RobTop said back on November 26th](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-is-finished-release-scheduled-for-early-december/) that the update was "about to be completely finished for release."

Him updating the 2.2 beta implies that [Geometry Dash 2.2](/categories/2.2/) is very much not finished for release despite the fact that he said it was about to be nearly 2 weeks ago.

This is alarming news, as it suggests that RobTop is still not even done update 2.2 and hasn't even sent it to stores for review yet, which he will need to do once the update is finished.

Since review can take up to a week, the fact that RobTop might not even be finished the update means we could still be weeks away from the release of Geometry Dash 2.2.

Instead of 2.2 releasing in Early December like RobTop suggested, we might be waiting until the end of December or even until 2024.

Friendly reminder that [this update was supposed to come out in October](/posts/final-geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-confirmed-by-robtop/).

Ultimately, we have three reasons for why RobTop updated the 2.2 beta. We've ordered them from best to worst case scenario:

1. RobTop is just testing stuff and Geometry Dash 2.2 will still arrive on time.
2. Apple, Google, or Steam requested something to be changed which is requiring RobTop is make changes and submit the update again for review.
3. RobTop has yet to even finish update 2.2 and is still working on it.
