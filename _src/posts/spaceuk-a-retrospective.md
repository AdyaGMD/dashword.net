Ever since SpaceUK was exposed in April 2023, I haven't stopped thinking about it, which is unlike any other hacking scandal in Geometry Dash history.

The main difference between SpaceUK and other hacking scandals is that SpaceUK genuinely robbed people. Not only of their accomplishments, but also of raw dollars.

SpaceUK robbed so many verifiers and first victors of deserved ad revenue, and instead, made thousands of dollars for himself by lying and cheating.

And somehow, this never got to him. He never decided that stealing all this was enough. He never decided to come clean. In fact, even when he was first exposed, he continued to lie.
