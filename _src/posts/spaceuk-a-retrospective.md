Ever since SpaceUK was exposed in April 2023, I haven't stopped thinking about it, which is unlike any other hacking scandal in Geometry Dash history.

The main difference between SpaceUK and other hacking scandals is that SpaceUK genuinely robbed people. Not only of their accomplishments, but also of raw dollars.

SpaceUK robbed so many verifiers and first victors of deserved ad revenue. Instead of coming clean, he stole thousands of dollars for himself by lying and cheating.

And somehow, this never got to him. He never decided that stealing all this clout and money was enough. He never decided to come clean. In fact, even when he was first exposed, he continued to lie.

And even his second and final apology, which was originally seen as truthful, has been called into question.

# When did SpaceUK start lying?

In SpaceUK's second apology, he claimed that the absurd difficulty jumps at the start of his career, such as The Golden being his fifth demon, are legitimate.

However, as [Samifying](https://youtu.be/9uLNjFiV1Is?si=hEJ-W31LVqY5PRoZ) noted, SpaceUK has been displayed on the in-game Cataclysm leaderboard since approximately June 2020, which would predate his attempts on The Golden.

This means that if SpaceUK didn't cheat prior to The Golden, he at the very least was lying. Which means his second apology also lied. So how can we know that everything else in there is truthful?

*As of the publication of this article, Samifying has not updated the pinned comment or description of his video with a possible explanation for this, so it does appear that SpaceUK was lying about his absurd difficulty jumps, at least to an extent.*

At the very least, this means SpaceUK has been lying since before The Golden, if not cheating. Maybe that is why he had no issue cheating and lying to the community and his closest friends for so long.

This could also explain his egotistical attitude towards the community, as throughout his entire career, he constantly downplayed his achievements and joked about being a hacker.

# Paying people back

In his second apology, SpaceUK said he would pay back some of the players who he robbed of ad revenue. According to Samifying's video, SpaceUK has paid popular Geometry Dash player Trick. Also according to that video, Doggie denied being paid by SpaceUK.

So while we can confirm that Trick has received some money from SpaceUK, there is no evidence known to Dashword that SpaceUK has paid anyone else.

We also think it is unlikely that SpaceUK would ever pay back everything he made, especially since he already [poured a lot of it into a new PC](/posts/top-1-geometry-dash-player-spaceuk-exposed-for-hacking-achievements/#spaceuk's-response).
