The Geometry Dash Awards are a yearly awards show for Geometry Dash levels and players hosted by [Geometry Dash Elder Moderator Viprin](/posts/geometry-dash-elder-moderator-viprin-responds-to-allegations-about-blackmail-spyware-and-inappropriate-encounters/).

The Awards are endorsed by [RobTop Games](/posts/robtop-face-reveal-all-known-pictures-of-robtop-games/), making them an official Geometry Dash event.

# What are the Geometry Dash Awards?

The Geometry Dash Awards are a yearly series of two videos: one announcing the nominees and one announcing the winners. The Awards committee chooses nominees [with help from the Geometry Dash community](/posts/you-can-suggest-nominees-for-the-geometry-dash-2023-awards-right-now/) and compiles a list of nominees for different categories.

The community then votes for their favorite nominee to determine the winner for each category.

# When are the Geometry Dash Awards?

While originally being done only once per Geometry Dash update, due to [Geometry Dash 2.2 taking so long to release](/posts/robtop-has-seemingly-not-even-submitted-geometry-dash-2-2-to-stores-for-review/), the Geometry Dash Awards were changed to be yearly.

The Geometry Dash 2023 Awards have already been announced but no exact dates were given.

# How to watch the Geometry Dash Awards?

The Geometry Dash Awards will premiere on [Viprin's YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@viprin?si=fp4kWcLwgzCiTL-d) every December. Keep an eye on [Viprin's community posts](https://youtube.com/@viprin/community) for updates.
