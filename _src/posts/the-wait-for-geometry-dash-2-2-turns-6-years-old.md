The wait for Geometry Dash 2.2 has turned 6 years old this January 16th. That means Geometry Dash has been on version 2.1 for more than half a decade.

Ultimately, this news is not exciting for Geometry Dash players. The community has been patiently waiting for so long, yet after six whole years, [update 2.2 is still not in sight](/categories/2.2/).

But fortunately, RobTop has recently broke his silence and [confirmed a new release date for Geometry Dash 2.2](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-confirmed-2023/).

Another thing that has made this long wait bearable is the [Geometry Dash 2.2 private server](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-private-server-download-install/), which gives a way to test out [Geometry Dash 2.2 Beta](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-beta-what-is-it/).
