The Apocalyptic Trilogy is an [upcoming top 1 extreme demon](/posts/geometry-dash-top-1-extreme-demon-tidal-wave-critiqued-as-controversial-but-original/) set to be verified by Trick. After over 7 years of creating, the APTeam has finally finished decorating it.

The Apocalyptic Trilogy is a level combining the gameplay and structuring of Cataclysm, Bloodbath, and Aftermath, the first two of which have been top 1 demons at some point.

Does this sound familiar? Well, this has been done before in a level called Aftercatabath.

The gameplay has all been buffed from Aftercatabath and lasts as just long as Dimrain47's classic song *At The Speed of Light*, which is about 4 minutes long.

Speaking of the song, in The Apocalyptic Trilogy's preview, the song appears to be a heavy metal cover of *At The Speed of Light*.

Popular YouTuber [AeonAir](https://youtu.be/q20g_Wb3zEM?si=16jiMX_-XAX_P2BM) has [expressed a bit of concern](/posts/geometry-dash-top-1-extreme-demon-tidal-wave-critiqued-as-controversial-but-original/) for the gameplay in the fact that it might be unbalanced due to the buffing, and I somewhat agree.

Still, there is a point to be made in that the levels The Apocalyptic Trilogy was based on (Cataclysm, Bloodbath, and Aftermath) are also unbalanced.

The decoration in The Apocalyptic Trilogy is stunning. It's a change from other red extreme demons, as it has a pretty original theme with lava, fire, rocks and many skulls. This all looks very realistic, overall going for a magma cavern theme.

Some parts have a more true red extreme demon theme and look a little more traditional, but they are well-made and don't stick out like a sore thumb. The decorators placed each detail to make each part look unique rather than to just overdecorated it.

I will say that some parts weren't merged super well, but that is a small problem. There are other things I like, such as the fact that it is an XXL level and has coins. The last top one to do that was Plasma Pulse Finale.

All in all, I would say that that The Apocalyptic Trilogy is an excellent level.
