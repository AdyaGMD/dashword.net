The Apocalyptic Trilogy is an upcoming top 1 extreme demon set to be verified by Trick. After over 7 years of creating, APTeam has finally finished decorating it.

The Apocalyptic Trilogy is a level combining the gameplay and structuring of Cataclysm, Bloodbath, and Aftermath, the first two of which have been top 1 demons at some point.

Does this sound familiar? Well, this has been done before in a level called Aftercatabath.

The gameplay has all been buffed from Aftercatabath and lasts as long as Dimrain47's classic song *At The Speed of Light*, which is about 4 minutes long.

Speakinf of the song, in The Apocalyptic Trilogy's preview, the song appears to be a heavy metal cover of *At The Speed of Light*.

Popular YouTuber Aeon Air has expressed a bit of concern for the gameplay in the fact that it might be unbalanced due to the buffing, and I somewhat agree.
Still, there is a point to be made in that the levels APT was based on are also unbalanced. Now the decoration is stunning. It’s a change from the red levels, as it has a pretty original hellscape with lava, fire, rock and many skulls, all looking pretty realistic, overall going for that magma cavern theme. Some parts have a more core hell theme and look a little more traditional, but they are well-made and don't stick out like a sore thumb. The decoration also has added detail to make each part look unique compared to the next, instead of just to make it more detailed. I will say that some parts don't merge very well, but that is a small problem. There are other things I like, such as the fact that it is an XXL level and has coins. The last top one to do that was PFP. All in all, I would say that It’s an excellent level.
