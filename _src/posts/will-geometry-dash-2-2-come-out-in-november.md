[After being delayed from September 2023 to November 2023](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-delayed-until-november-2023/), RobTop Games has shown no sign that Geometry Dash 2.2 will even release in November.

RobTop said that [he would only delay Geometry Dash 2.2 if something really bad showed up](/posts/robtop-confirms-geometry-dash-2-2-is-still-set-for-a-november-release-date/). Perhaps the [Dash Orb issues he was fixing are bad enough to delay the update yet again](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-trigger-menu-revealed/).

It was one month ago today that RobTop officially delayed Geometry Dash 2.2, meaning that if he plans to delay the update again, he will likely announce it today.

We will [post a new 2.2 article if RobTop makes a statement](/categories/2.2/).
