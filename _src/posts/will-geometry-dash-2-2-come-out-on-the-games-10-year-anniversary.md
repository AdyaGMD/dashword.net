RobTop Games has reported that there will be a special video premiering on Geometry Dash's 10th anniversary (August 13th). With this, many speculate the [Geometry Dash 2.2 release date](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-may-be-pushed-back-again/)—or even [Geometry Dash 2.2 itself](/categories/2.2/)—will be released.

While there is no direct evidence that anything relating to Geometry Dash 2.2 will be revealed on this day, the fact that RobTop and other [Geometry Dash moderators](/posts/geometry-dash-moderator-says-2-2-is-right-around-the-corner/) have hyped this video up so much suggests it has incredible importance.

Earlier this year, [Dashword predicted that Geometry Dash 2.2 could release this month](/posts/robtop-confirms-third-and-final-geometry-dash-2-2-release-date/), meaning it is entirely possible that Geometry Dash 2.2 is ready.

However, it is equally possible that this video will just be exactly what they say it is: a montage of everything the Geometry Dash community has done in 10 years.

Instead of releasing update 2.2 or giving a release date, we think it is more likely that RobTop will reveal some Geometry Dash 2.2 news. While this is exciting, it is not as exciting as a potential Geometry Dash 2.2 release date.

What do you think will happen on the game's anniversary?
