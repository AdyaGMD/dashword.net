RobTop Games has reported that there will be a special video premiering on Geometry Dash's 10th anniversary. With this, many speculate the [Geometry Dash 2.2 release date](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-may-be-pushed-back-again/)—or even [Geometry Dash 2.2 itself](/categories/2.2/)—will be released.

While there is no direct evidence that anything relating to Geometry Dash 2.2 will be revealed on this day, the fact that RobTop and other [Geometry Dash moderators](/posts/geometry-dash-moderator-says-2-2-is-right-around-the-corner/) have hyped this video up so much suggests it has incredible importance.
