Right now, Viprin has shared the final [Geometry Dash 2023 Awards](/posts/how-to-fix-youtuber-inclusivity-in-the-geometry-dash-awards/) preliminary form! In it, you can suggest nominees who you think deserve a nomination in each category.

You can suggest multiple people per category and you don't have to answer every question. Consider taking the form now to let your voice be heard!

[Viprin said this](https://twitter.com/vipringd/status/1731128647551991914) in regards to the Awards:

> It's soon time for the Geometry Dash 2023 Awards. With 2.1 coming to an end soon, this seems like a good time to get some final suggestions from the community. Thanks to everyone who votes!

You can suggest nominees through this form: [Geometry Dash 2023 Awards Prelimary Form](https://forms.gle/hJhTwkgrx1ynniwx6).

As the author of this article, consider suggesting me for best YouTuber! Unlike most of your other favorite YouTubers, I have not yet had an opportunity to get nominated for any Geometry Dash Awards yet.

You can suggest multiple people per category by separating them with commas, like this example: 

> Tride, Sdslayer, Moldy

Thanks for your consideration!
